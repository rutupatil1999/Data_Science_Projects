      "after the first case was detected in china on december 31st 2019 it was an ai program developed by bluedot that alerted the world about the pandemic it was quick to realise ais ability to analyse large chunks of data could help in detecting patterns and identifying and tracking the possible carriers of the virus\n",
      "many tracing apps use ai to keep tabs on the people who have been infected and prevent the risk of crossinfection by using ai algorithms that can track patterns and extract some features to classify or categorise them\n",
      "so how does ai do that\n",
      "ibm watson a sophisticated ai that works on cloud computing and natural language processing has prominently contributed to the healthcare sector on a global level being a conversational ai since 2013 watson has helped in recommending treatments to patients suffering from cancer to ensure that they get the best treatment at optimum costs\n",
      "researchers at google inc showed that an ai system can be trained on thousands of images to achieve physicianlevel sensitivity\n",
      "by identifying the molecular patterns associated with disease status and its subtypes gene expression and protein abundance levels machine learning methods can detect fatal diseases like cancer at an early stage machine learning ml techniques focus mainly on analyzing structured data which can further help in clustering patients traits and infer the probability of disease outcomes since patient traits mainly include masses of data relating to age gender disease history diseasespecific data like diagnostic imaging and gene expressions etc ml can extract features from these data inputs by constructing data analytical algorithms\n",
      "ml algorithms are either supervised or unsupervised unsupervised learning helps in extracting features and clustering similar features together that further leads to early detection of diseases clustering and principal component analysis enable grouping or clustering of similar traits together that are further used to maximize or minimize the similarity between the patients within or between the clusters since patient traits are recorded in multiple dimensions such as genes principal component analysispca creates the apparatus to reduce these dimensions which humans could have not done alone\n",
      "supervised learning considers the outcomes of the subjects together with the traits and further correlates the inputs with the outputs to predict the probability of getting a particular clinical event expected value of a disease level or expected survival time or risk of downs syndrome\n",
      "biomarker panels that are mostly used to detect ovarian cancer have outperformed the conventional statistical methods due to machine learning in addition to this the use of ehrs and bayesian networks which are a part of supervised machine learning algorithms can predict clinical outcomes and mortality respectively\n",
      "unstructured data such as clinical notes and texts are converted into machinereadable structured data with the help of natural language processingnlp nlp works with two components text processing and classification text processing helps in identifying a series of diseaserelevant keywords in clinical notes and then through classification are further categorized into normal and abnormal cases chest screening through ml and nlp has helped find abnormalities in the lungs and provide treatment to covid patients healthcare organizations use nlpbased chatbots to increase interactions with patients keeping their mental health and wellness in check\n",
      "deep learning is a modern extension of the classical neural network techniques which helps explore more complex nonlinear patterns in data using algorithms like convolution neural network recurrent neural network deep belief network and deep neural network which enables more accurate clinical prediction when it comes to genome interpretation deep neural networks surpass the conventional methods of logistics regression and support vector machines\n",

      "robotic surgery is widely considered in most delicate surgeries like gynaecology and prostate surgery even after striking the right balance between human decisions and ai precision robotic surgery reduces surgeon efficiency as they have to be manually operated through a console thus autonomous robotic surgery is on the rise with inventions such as robotic silicon fingers that mimic the sense of touch that surgeons need to identify organs cut tissues etc or robotic catheters that can navigate whether it is touching blood tissue or valve\n",
      "researchers at childrens national hospital washington have already developed an ai called smart tissue autonomous robot star which performs a colon anastomosis on its own with the help of an mlpowered suturing tool that automatically detects the patients breathing pattern to apply suture at the correct point\n",

      "intelligence calls out for supremacy and so what if there was to evolve something that opposed a challenge to the very human minds to their capabilities while making them question their own importance among themselves artificial intelligence came as a revolution havoc when it first came to the light the concept of making machines does work on their own like granting machines the intelligence\n",
      "the idea of making machines work like humans came back in the 19s back then people didnt believe in such a thing as making a nonliving thing work think and carry tasks on its own not to mention to actually surpass humans themselves in those skills the facts are it did by 1997 the greatest chess player garry kasparov was defeated in a chess game by a machine and this is where exactly a top skilled human lost to a mere machine created by another who by himself couldve never defeated him it was a rule of power of betterment of skills and the granted supremacy were ai and machines just tools equipment  something that helped an unskilled person with his mind and intelligence creates something that could do the skilled work for him with perfection and precision well initially it was however as time passed as humans got drawn to the puzzle of ai a lot changed human research went deeper and deeper and as a result the machines evolved with it\n",
      "at present ai  machines is a growing field as it develops and improves it has become a part of the industrial revolution in industries most of the laborious work that was once taken care of by humans was now replaced by machines naturally with the evolution in machines its precision mass productivity quality control time efficiencies and all the other factors made it a better choice a choice over humans\n",
      "this led to fear a fear of a notsodistant future a future where maybe machines will be so evolved that theyll take over the need of a human employee leading to unemployment with the population increase around the world it became the new tech threat for the labor market then again how true is it does ai really oppose a threat will adapting to technology make millions of people lose their jobs will it lead to mass unemployment will the machines really surpass humans will the creation take over the creator\n",
      "no matter how fearful the future with ai may seem in reality it is not that scary truth is ai is the present reality it is the key that holds the power to unlock a whole next level of human evolution technology is growing there was a time where technology was just an idea but today that idea has been implemented its working and is carried out nobody could stop the advancement and growth of artificial intelligence its a wave that is already flowing and we as the present generation and the generations to come to have to learn to learn to swim in this flow and avoid drowning\n",
      "many jobs will be replaced by machines as ai evolves itll keep challenging human minds and their skills with the present covid 19 situation contactless cashiers to robots delivering packages have already taken over the usual routine tasks the jobs of secretaries schedulers and bookkeeper are at risk too manufacturing units agriculture food services retail transportation  logistic and hospitality are all a part of the aiaffected automation at an estimation it is said that around 20 million jobs especially including manufacturing will be lost to robots as ai robotics 3d printing and genetics make their way in even the architects medical docs and music composers feel threatened by technology making us question that will ai even edge us out of our brain jobs too now that can be terrifying\n",
      "however as much as machines will be replacing few jobs theyll also be creating new jobs  with the economic growth innovation and investment around 133 million jobs are said to be generated these newly enhanced jobs are to create benefits and amplify ones creativity strategy and entrepreneurial skills so what is the catch\n",
      "well its the skills even though ai is creating 3 times more jobs than it is destroying its the skills that count ai surged in new job opportunities opportunities like senior data scientist mobile application developer and seo specialist these jobs were once never heard of but now with ai its born however to do these jobs or for its qualification one needs highlevel skills and to acquire those skills can be an expensive and timeconsuming task the future generation might be able to cope up with it but the real struggle is to be faced by the present two generations its the vulnerability between the skill gap and unemployment and the youths are the ones to be crushed the most\n",
      "therefore as the advancement of ai becomes inevitable there remains no choice but to adapt learn equip ourselves and grow with it the companies have to work together to build an aiready workplace they should collaborate with the government educators and nonprofit organizations and work together to bring out policies that could help understand the technologies impacts faster while also providing the employees some security the economic and business planning should be made considerable for minimizing the impact on local jobs and properly maximizing the opportunities\n",
      "the employees should be provided with proper tools to carry along with the new opportunities while acquiring aibased skills for their daytoday work new skills should be identified and implemented for the upskilling and continual learning initiatives employees will have to maximize their robotic quotient and learn core skills theyll have to adapt to new working models and understand their roles in the coming future \n",
      "howsoever its not like ai will totally take over control even though ai proves to be a better choice it still has its limitations at present first its expensive secondly manufacturing machines in bulk is not good for the environment machines are also very high maintenance therefore human labor will often come cheaper and so will be considered over machines underdeveloped countries will find it hard to equip their people with the upskilling and reskilling required for ai workplace and so for ai to play a role in those countries might take years ai can also be risky and unethical as its hard to figure out who to be held responsible for in cases where an ai went wrong\n",
      "no matter how advanced ai gets there are some skills where humans will always have an upper hand ie soft skills skills like teamwork communication creativity and critical thinking are something that ai hasnt been able to beat us up to yet and so the value of creativity leadership and emotional intelligence has increased although with machines coming in between humans causing the lack of humantohuman interaction the humans seem to fade away a little\n",
      "with this era comes the need for good leaders leaders who are capable of handling both machines and humans together the ones who are organized enough to manage the skilled and the unskilled employees while providing the unskilled trainees with proper training leaders who hold profound soft skills and encourage teamwork while working along with machines the ones who are patient calm and optimized  \n",
      "in conclusion yes ai and machines are going to be very challenging but theres nothing humans havent overcome adaptation and upgradation are going to be the primary factor for survival as we witness the onset of the 4th industrial revolution lets buckle up our seats and race along the highway with the essential fuels skills so as to not let ourselves eliminated after all this is an unending race with infinity as the end all we could do is try not to run out of fuel try not to be outdated\n",

      "ai is rapidly evolving in the employment sector particularly in matters involving business and finance finance management economics and accounting are now among the most popular university courses globally particularly at the graduate level due to their high employability however the evolution of machinery in industries is changing that according to research 230000 jobs in these sectors may be replaced by ai agents in the next 5 years this is due to the nature of the work as employees are responsible for tasks such as data analysis and keeping track of numerical information which machines excel at large complicated data sets can be analyzed faster and more efficiently by aipowered computers than by people algorithmic trading procedures that produce automated deals are less likely to be produced without minute errors when undertaken by humans in such matters involving industrial work a subsection of artificial intelligence is used namely machine learning\n",
      "machine learning is a term used for the application of artificial intelligence ai in systems which involves them assimilating and processing information by gaining experience it is mainly concerned with the development of technology and computer programs\n",
      " its improvement process is mainly divided into seven steps which start with the collection of data this data can be collected from an internal database or perhaps an iot structure the second and most timeconsuming step is cleaning preparing and rearranging the data which involves the recognition of outliers trends and missing information so that the outcome is as accurate as possible the third step consists of formatting data which is useful if you source your information from a variety of sources step four is where ai comes into place selfservice data processing tools may be useful if they provide intelligent services for matching data attributes from distinct databases and intelligently integrating them the data is then arranged to better represent a specific pattern lastly the data is divided into two sets one for training the algorithm and one for analysis\n",
      "there are three types of machine learning supervised unsupervised and reinforcement learning the most common of the bunch is supervised machine learning which is based on accurately labeled data the machine is given a collection of information including the outcome of the operation the rest of the information is referred to as input features which supervises the machine by guiding it to establish the connections between the variants\n",
      "in the case of unsupervised learning the machine isnt given labeled sets of data to be divided into allowing it to recognize and create its own patterns within the information provided since computers have the capabilities of identifying distinguished similarities this method helps with the classifying of such data\n",
      "reinforcement learning comprises experiencebased learning similar to people they learn due to a reward and punishment system based on their actions\n",
      "these variations of system learning have recently been integrated into business and finance which is elaborated on in the following passages\n",
      "machine learning in finance and banking\n",
      "there are many ways in which machine learning is used in finance and banking the most common place it is used is to detect any frauds fraud is the most common problem in financial service companies and it accounts for billions of dollars in misfortune each year the most common frauds are credit or debit card usage by a stranger document forgery and mortgage fraud\n",
      "usually finance companies keep an enormous amount of their data stored online and it increases the risk of information being accessed without authorization with expanding innovative headway misrepresentation in the monetary business is currently viewed as a high danger to significant information fraud recognition frameworks in the past were planned dependent on a bunch of rules which could be effortlessly be bypassed by current fraudsters therefore most companies today leverage machine learning to combat fraudulent financial transactions\n",
      " machine learning works by looking over enormous informational indexes to distinguish unique or suspicious activities for additional examination by security groups it works by looking at an exchange against other information focuses  like the clients record history ip address area and so forth  depending on the type of exchange taking place the program can automatically refuse a withdrawal or purchase until the person makes a decision\n",
      "examples of fraud detection software used by banks include feedzai data visor and teradata\n",
      "machine learning is also used in algorithmic trading portfolio management loan underwriting chatbots and improving customer service\n",
      "algorithmic trading is an interaction for executing orders using computerized and premodified exchanging guidelines to represent factors like value timing and volume an algorithm is a set of directions for solving a problem computer calculations send little parts of the full request to the market over the long run\n",
      "in contrast to human dealers algorithmic exchanging can investigate enormous volumes of information every day and therefore make thousands of trades every day machine learning settles on quick exchanging choices which gives human traders a benefit over the market normal likewise algorithmic exchanging doesnt settle on exchanging choices dependent on feelings which is a typical constraint among human dealers whose judgment might be influenced by feelings or individual desires the exchanging technique is generally utilized by multifaceted investment administrators and monetary foundations to automate trading activities\n",
      "in the banking industry organizations access a large number of shopper information with which machine learning can be prepared to work in order to simplify the underwriting process machine learning calculations can settle on speedy choices on endorsing and credit scoring and save organizations both time and monetary assets that are utilized by people\n",
      "data scientists can train algorithms on how to analyze millions of consumer data to coordinate with information records search for interesting special cases and settle on a choice on whether a shopper meets all requirements for an advance or protection for instance the calculation can be prepared on the most proficient method to examine shopper information like age pay occupation and the buyers credit conduct\n",
      "the benefits of machine learning\n",
      "as with any form of revolutionary technology the usage of machine learning has been debated over as its beneficial properties have been weighed against the possible disadvantages its been observed that upon correct usage it may be used to solve a wide range of business challenges and anticipate complicated customer behavior weve also seen several of the largest it conglomerates such as google amazon and microsoft introduce cloud machine learning platforms\n",
      "in terms of business ml can aid businesses by identifying consumers demands and formulate a pattern based on them allowing companies to reach out to such consumers and maximize their sales it eliminates the need for expenses on some maintenance by reducing the risks associated with unexpected breakdowns and minimizes wasteful costs to the firms  historical data a process visualization tool a flexible analytical environment and a feedback loop may all be used to build an ml architecture the input of data is another agitating chore for businesses in the present which is where machine learning can step in for manual labor this eradicates the possibility of errors caused by manual labor causing disruptions and provides employees with extra time to handle other tasks\n",
      "in the financial sector machine learning is already utilized for portfolio management algorithmic trading loan underwriting and fraud detection chatbots and other conversational interfaces for security customer support and sentiment analysis will be among the future uses of ml in banking another aspect of business involving artificial intelligence includes image recognition which entails a system or program that recognizes objects people places and movements in photos it identifies photographs using an imaging system and machine recognition tech with artificial intelligence and programmed algorithms\n",
      "the downfalls of machine learning\n",
      "with all the benefits of its advancement machine learning isnt the most perfect thing there are several disadvantages which are information acquisition time and resources and high errors and wrong interpretations one of the major hurdles is the amount of finance needed to invest in machine learning for it to be a successful project more issues have to do with the fact that ai requires gigantic informational indexes to train on and these ought to be unbiased and of good quality there can likewise be times where they have to wait for that new information to be produced machine learning needs sufficient opportunity to do the calculations to learn and adequately to satisfy their accuracy and relevancy it also needs huge resources to work this can mean extra requirements for the computer to work another significant problem is the capacity to precisely decipher the results produced by the calculations you should likewise cautiously pick the algorithms to get the wanted results\n",
      "conclusion\n",
      "there have been various reports in the past and current years which claim that a significant piece of the human labor force will be replaced via robots and machines in the years to come with excessive innovative work being led in the field of computerized reasoning many dread that a significant job crisis will unfurl since numerous positions are all the more precisely and productively performed with the use of machines in countries like japan mainly computer programs and ai is used in the secondary and tertiary sectors from cleaning the house to depositing money in banks everything is done by ai however ai cannot replace humans in the future humans have several capabilities which even after several technological advancements a machine would not be able to have these capabilities include creative thinking and creative problem solving and human connection for example when a child goes to a doctor to get an injection a nurse always relaxes the child to not be afraid of the needle a machines touch would not be able to soothe a child another example could be how humans tend to share things with each other and be open about it a machine will not be able to do so since it is only programmed to things it has been told to do like computers ai will not replace us but would however complement us to make daily work easier and less timeconsuming without humans themselves there is no future for ai\n",

      "ais allow for the automation of jobs thereby replacing what humans already do this means more job loss and the concentration of wealth to the selected few people this could mean a destabilization of society and social unrest in addition to social unrest ai improves over time this means it becomes smarter faster and cheaper to implement and it will be better at doing repetitive things that humans currently do such as preparing fast food it is predicted that ai will improve so much over 50 to 100 years that ai will become super intelligent this means that it will become even smarter than the most intelligent human on earth according to many experts such as elon musk this could cause the end of human civilization ai could potentially start a war against humans burn crops and do all sorts of tragedies once reserved for human functions at that point in theory we can not stop it because ai would have already thought of all the obstacles that will prevent its goal this means that we cannot unplug the machine in effect ai will replace human intelligence\n",
      "but will this happen in next 10 to 30 years\n",
      "no the field of artificial intelligence is sophisticated enough to do many human tasks that humans currently do currently ai is not smart enough to be empathetic to humans and cannot think strategically enough to solve complex problems ai solutions can be expensive and have to go through many different tests and standards to implement it also takes time for ai to improve for example boston dynamics one of the worlds top robotics company had a robot in 2009 that needed assistance to walk fast forward to 2019 not only the robot could walk by itself but it could jump over objects do backflips and so much more in addition to the timing it takes time for the price of any new technological solution to drop to a point where it is affordable for example a desktop computer costs around 1000 in 1999 but now you can get a significantly more powerful laptop for the exact same price ai will go through the same curve\n",
      "but what happens after those 10 to 30 years will ai make human intelligence obsolete maybe as we have proven earlier ai will become faster better and cheaper as this happens more and more companies will use ai technology to automate more and more jobs to save money increase productivity and most importantly stay competitive as we have demonstrated ai will become better through repetition via the use of machine learning the only difference is that ai will be able to learn faster as time progresses due to the amount of data that is available today it will also be able to learn from other machines or similar machines to learn how to optimize its tasks or new important skills however ai also just not do repetitive and routine tasks better it will also be able to understand emotional intelligence ethics and creativity this seen in three distinct example ibm\n",

      "if history has taught us anything it is that disruptive paradigmshifting business ideas not only make a fortune for the innovators but they also build the groundwork for new business models market entrants and job opportunities which will inevitably follow it is true that robots today or in future will eventually replace humans for many jobs but so did innovative farming equipment for humans and horses during the industrial revolution but that does not mean that our jobs as humans will end here we on the other hand will be required to generate and provide value in whole new ways for entirely new business models as a result of these changes\n",
      "according to 71 of the businesses worldwide artificial intelligence can help people overcome critical and challenging problems and live better lives artificial intelligence consultants at work will be more or equally fair according to a whopping 83 of corporate leaders these results demonstrate that artificial intelligence is steadily extending its measures yielding societal benefits and allowing citizens to live more fulfilling lives\n",
      "since the advent of industry 40 businesses are moving at a fast pace towards automation be it any type of industry in 2013 researchers at oxford university did a study on the future of work they concluded that almost one in every two jobs have a high risk of being automated by machines machine learning is responsible for this disruption it is the most powerful branch of artificial intelligence it allows machines to learn from data and mimic some of the things that humans can do\n",
      "a research was conducted by the employees of kaggle wherein an algorithm was to be created to take images of a human eye and diagnose an eye disease known as diabetic retinopathy here the winning algorithm could match the diagnosis given by human ophthalmologists another study was conducted wherein an algorithm should be created to grade high school essays here too the winning algorithm could match the grade given by human teachers\n",

      "before i go on i think its best to level set on what constitutes machines in the context of this article  machines describe computers and computerized equipment like robots that have been programmed to learn sometimes like humans occasionally we call this artificial intelligence ai other times we call this machine learning and still other times we call this robotics and yes these are technically different things these bots are more efficient than humans in some specific domains and are growing smarter with each passing day they can do some really tough tasks which are considered difficult for any human being  but within the broad discussion related to the future of work these are totally interrelated factory floors deploy robots that are increasingly driven by machine learning algorithms such that they can adjust to people working alongside them a machine can work efficiently only it has abundant data and information about the work which is being imparted daily to them but with every forward step  advancement in technology a threat is proliferating a threat of being replaced on our work front every passing day is sealing some jobs for humans all over the globe similarly ai is being used to turn handdrawn sketches done by humans into digital source code\n",

      "during the next few decades or maybe sooner the notion of work and whether it is handled by a human or a virtual being will hinge on predictability as they are starting to do today machines will manage the routine while humans take on the unpredictable  tasks that require creativity problemsolving and flexibility in this context robotics should be seen not only as a means to improve operations efficiency but also to improve the quality of life for workers\n",
      "although it is obvious that human factors involved in a work activity impact job automation it is also true that highly repetitive tasksand even mechanical onesare ideal for robots besides greater efficiency and speed automation leads to a lower risk of accidents greater control and autonomy and above all fewer costs for organizations\n",
      "although artificial intelligence and machine learning make us believe that robots are endowed with superior intelligence in fact they dont yet have the ability to learn from experience and to respond to unknowns so as things stand however much processing speed and automatic learning a robot has it doesnt beat factors innate to the human brain humans are still a very essential part of the process think about delivering services to a client most customer challenges are routine but humans play a very important role in addressing new issues solving them the first time they appear and then consolidating the process into the system\n",
      "while machines and humans are placed in proximity  robots can be expensive but this doesnt apply to all types especially those based on robotic process automation rpa where the development process incorporates algorithms that significantly reduce costs\n",

      "soon braincomputer interfaces could become seamless as well creating a new synergistic relationship between the cloud and us at that point the question of who knows what would be moot you ask me a question and i know the answer sometimes that answer will be stored in my own neural circuitry but most of the time it would come from the connection of my neurons to the web our brains decision process is influenced by the way it has been educated by the cultural context these external factors are influencing our decision processes to the point that in certain situations we can legitimately claim that influence has been so strong that our brains cant be held accountable for the choices made the point im trying to make is that we humans are in symbiosis with our cultural environment and the tools  both physical and conceptual  that we have been taught to use my guess is that the transformation will be subtle\n",
      "practically speaking robots growing to the point that they take over the world and then start creating smarter better robots are impractical and should not even be a concern none of this is expected in the near future not by a long shot if youve been to an atm waited for a pc to boot up after a catastrophic failure or had a game crash on your x box just when you were about to reach a checkpoint you understand that we are not in a world where machines do everything perfectly right before they can take over all of our jobs they need to be able to do theirs flawlessly until then we can depend on humans to mess up our lives \n",

      "first things first machine learning needs training data and training data costs money especially training data labeled by humans let me explain to make machine learning work for business the algorithm needs to see lots and lots of examples of what its supposed to be doing if you want an algorithm to tell you if a sales lead is good you need to show it lots and lots of examples of good sales leads and bad sales leads if you want an algorithm to tag the support tickets you need to show it many examples of support tickets if you localize your algorithm to a new language you probably need to collect lots of examples in that language in some instances a company may have those training sets inhouse for example a bunch of disqualified or qualified leads but say you havent labeled each of your support tickets as theyve come in over the year youd need to have people either inhouse or en masse via a data enrichment platform label those tickets the machine will then look at those judgments and start finding connections and patterns it can learn from\n",
      "machine learning is much cheaper and more efficient than people when it works well the downside is that it often works well in 80 percent of the cases and badly in 20 percent of the cases and lowering the 20 percent error rate is hard if not impossible but even an 80 percent accurate algorithm can save you a lot of money because good machine learning algorithms know where they are accurate and where they are more likely to have errors smart companies take the cases where the algorithm has high confidence and uses those directly while sending low confidence cases to humans banks have been doing this for years when you put a check in an atm an algorithm tries to decipher the numbers on the check if you have really sloppy handwriting or the ink is smudged the algorithm passes the task to a human this design pattern saves banks lots of money while preserving a very high level of accuracy\n",
      "a huge benefit of machine learning is that it can turn part of your variable cost into more of a fixed cost if you use humans to handle cases where that algorithm is struggling you are creating the perfect training data to feed into your algorithm this is a wellstudied technique called active learning it turns out that training data labels collected on cases where the algorithm has low confidence help the algorithm learn much much more efficiently\n",

      "a technological revolution simply means that we are in a period where better and newer technologies replace the others to get the job done faster and better we are in an era with rapid innovations where machines are being compared to humans\n",
      "\n",
      "so then what is machine learning\n",
      "machine learning is basically the application of artificial intelligence into electronic systems to enable them to learn and enhance themselves without being programmed by humans it is the evolution and development of computer programs that can access data and then use it to advance themselves whether you know it or not you use machine learningpowered applications daily\n",
      "now what is artificial intelligence\n",
      "at its simplest form artificial intelligence is a field which combines computer science and robust datasets to enable problemsolving \n",
      "in simple words artificial intelligence is the technology that facilitates these machines to perform human like behaviour\n",
      "just like every other industry machine learning is playing its role in the finance and banking industry too in most cases where a human would perform the same task by performing the same calculations or following the same process can be taught to the machine which can now perform it by itself\n",
      "let us discuss a few examples of the applications that we might have come in our day to day running which are a result of machine learning in this industry\n",
      "portfolio management\n",
      "in earlier days an investor would need to consult a financial advisor to understand hisher risk appetite and advise accordingly today using machine learning algorithms there exists the concept of a roboadvisor that requires any user to give certain inputs about their financial status and goals and calculates their risk tolerance and constructs and idle portfolio allocation for them young users today find this extremely useful rather than physically visiting an advisor and paying a fee for doing so\n",
      "risk underwriting\n",
      "underwriting is one of the core functions for most financial institutions especially banks and insurance companies where they are required to underwrite the risk of the customers before loaning out money or insurance policies these underwriting activities are based on trends and thumb rules industrywide the same has been introduced through machine learning which is able to underwrite risks today on a larger and more accurate scale\n",
      "algorithmic trading\n",
      "machine learning is a mathematical model that tracks market information analyses massive data sources and study market conditions simultaneously to detect patterns which can be used for trading this is humanly impossible to do in a fraction of time algorithmic systems can make millions of trades daily often known as highfrequency trading it is highly believed that deep learning is playing its role in calibrating realtime trading decisions\n",
      "fraud detection\n",
      "with the increase in use and dependency on computers for financial transactions came the data security risk there is an ample amount of valuable data stored online available to create potential risk machine learning thus helped in fraud detection by detecting anomalies in transactions and flagging them for scrutiny based on the risk factors defined by the institutions fraud identification in insurance claims credit card payments identity theft account theft are all areas in fraud detection that machine learning can help in\n",
      "process automation\n",
      "process automation is one of the most common applications of machine learning in finance the technology has helped in replacing manual work automate repetitive tasks to avoid redundancy and as a result increase productivity machine learning has benefitted these organizations to optimize costs improve customer experiences and scale up their services some examples of financial and banking firms using process automation are the use of chatbots automated calls paperwork automation and gamified employee training\n",
      "customer onboarding\n",
      "in this highly competitive industry customer acquisition and the customer onboarding process is highly relevant in building a good customer relationship at any stage during the onboarding a slight inconvenience or delay can act as a barrier machine learningenabled complete automation in this process for these financial and banking institutions today from opening an account filing for any application can be completed within a few minutes with utmost ease with ai customers behavioral patterns have been studied to improvise and make the whole process efficient and userfriendly\n",
      "customer churn\n",
      "with the multitude of offerings and availability of a plethora of options customer stickiness is a big problem faced by financial firms customer churn forecasting is one of the best big data use cases it helps in detecting customers who cancel their subscription and analyses the same to tailor products as per customer needs video streaming application netflixs subscribers worldwide has continued to grow to reach 167 million through using machine learning analytics on their customer database\n",
      "decision making\n",
      "financial and banking institutions function on facilitating investments made by their customers organizations are constantly in search of customers from whom they can get more revenue this is now possible through performing machine learning analysis on both structured and unstructured data which helps them make more informed decisions it also analyses data from the website and mobile application to construct effective marketing campaigns for the targeted customers\n",
      "future of machine learning in finance\n",
      "financial monitoring security analysis prevention of money laundering network security investment predictions personalization of customer service everything comes under the realm of the applications of machine learning in the financial and banking industry yet this is just the tip of the iceberg there is a lot more that is going to change in the future it is now visibly imperative that while ai is beginning to create a wave of transformation across these industries and adapting to these changes s important for ones survival with smart technology applied everywhere all financial firms are bound to turn into fintechs to stay relevant to the silver tech generation consisting of millennials and the genzs\n",
      "final thoughts\n",
      "the financial services industry has entered the space of artificial intelligence and machine learning and the pace is not surprising knowing the positive changes it has brought machine learning has the most use cases in finance than any other industry because of the available computer power and new machine learning tools the greatest applications include simplifying customer engagement and accurate sales forecasting it is only making this industry better and more efficient with each new adaptation machine learning algorithms have the capability to deal with a lot more than human capacity along with eliminating human error as even the algorithms are constantly learning and innovating they can serve as a bridge to a completely flawless automated financial system in the future nonetheless the challenges of high cost and lack of resources that come along play a significant role in how early these firms can adopt these technologies but even then the future seems bright as the industry has enough adopters and prospects ready to explore\n",

      "now the question that arises is what does ai entails for the future\n",
      "ai is fancy enough to continue existing in our minds all the time but it does come with certain limitations and threats which is a cause for a peaceful sleep for most of the workers with its introduction to different areas of the workplace it is clear that half of the human jobs would be taken up by ai and then there would arise a need for more jobs for humans in new upcoming aibased ventures in different industries thereby giving us our fair share back to us\n",
      "in a survey it was found that some believed that ai will be devastating for humans and while some professionals and techsavvy people believed that inculcating ai technology into business and our daily lives would be a remarkable step as it will lead to the flourishment of business in the future and give them a competitive edge over their rivals\n",
      "people believed that when these advanced technologies would come together to work with humans they will produce a smarter strategic decision with productive collaborative practices more modern technology prevailing in the organization will lead to stress reduction and produce more satisfying results thereby making the organization more efficient\n",
      "the organizations who are in use of the ai technology responds by saying that their managers are more comfortable using ai and are accustomed to it and the organizations are now looking forward to having integration of higherend technology systems as it is believed that new technology will result in more productivity thereby making more profits in the long run\n",
      "many jobs today require ai and humans working in collaboration which creates a positive signal that in the future to humans would be working closely with the technology beyond just training and developing these machines humans would be working in close vicinity with them and making decisions on how to act on the result that is given by the machine\n",

      "the workforce of the longer term will lean more towards innovation and creativity businesses have spent higher a part of the previous couple of years studying ai automation and the way they will leverage it to realize results fast with statistics showing that workers spend up to 40 percent of their hours at work performing repetitive tasks every business should consider automating any functions which will be automated automation is not new machines have been replacing human labor in different areas for decades\n",
      "however within the coming years mundane daily tasks will become fully automated already 39 percent of organizations were completely reliant on automation in 2018 with repetitive tasks taken care of employees can focus their energies on highvalue customeroriented tasks and collaboration the designs of workplaces and workflows will also change with the implementation of ai technology more people will begin to figure more closely with machines as companies will strive to become more agile\n",

      "apart from increasing productivity ai systems will help businesses to chop down on costs improve the standard of their products or services and make better customer profiles as a result companies also will get higher profits which may be shared among stakeholders as dividends or reinvest it back within the business improved productivity also means firms are going to be ready to sell their products at lower prices thereby creating more demand among customers and more job opportunities for workers businesses can therefore use human labor to take up those jobs that have been created by ai and cannot be automated\n",

      "ai experts believe its going to be one of the main drivers of the fourth industrial revolution and that it has the potential to not just transform the tech sectors and going to open a new chapter of the society of the world that people try to understand themselves better rather than the outside world with ai because people who are naysayer and kind of try to drum up these doomsday scenarios are pretty irresponsible after all in the next five to ten years ai is going to deliver so many improvements and the quality of our lives it is a renaissance a golden age of machine learning and artificial intelligence that was the realm of science fiction for the last several decades ai is probably the most important thing humanities that have ever worked which is more profound than any work with technology as it is important to harness the benefits and while minimizing the downside is focusing on autonomous systems like selfdriving cars seen as the mother of all ai projects and has made applications like selfdriving technology viable for the first time three things happen at the same time number one data collection and data processing became easier because of better technologies right um you need data to fuel ai training and thats been one of the big drivers the second thing that has happened is that computer processing has become faster thats like the engine so no matter how much fuel you have if you dont have that engine and processing the data on a timeframe thats reasonable was just not possible and the third thing thats happened is that new algorithms have been developed which has made ai much more powerful so has been changing and developing at a pace thats much faster than ever before and we have not been used to this rapid pace of change which means that we have not been used to thinking about how its going to impact our immediate future the most important factor responsible for the growth of ai is google and its ai what googles done is given all of us the power to get the relevant information we want at our fingertips this has created a shift in how things are bought but it didnt happen overnight this started in 2004 but the major change only happens to start 2012 onwards googles taken away about 65 of sales peoples jobs that were primarily order takers and the ones that are remaining are likely to be gone over the next decade\n",
      "in present several ai projects are helping in diagnosing diseases better match up drugs with people depending on what theyre sick they can get treated better so its going to help a whole lot of people get treated and get better than would have had access to it before if you look at selfdriving cars theyre going to be safer than people driving cars and the value that machine learning is providing is actually happening beneath the surface and it is things like improved search results improved product recommendations for customers improve forecasting for inventory management and literally hundreds of other things including speechrecognition or imagerecognition that the performance levels are phenomenal  or drug discovery as these biological systems are very complicated because vaccines for tb and hiv developing thats notably enabled by this rich data advanced in biology and machine learning and recent invention in which is an application we just launched for anybody with visual impairment ass it uses the latest cuttingedge computer vision technology to give anyone the ability to see so anyone who has dyslexia can now use ai to be able to read better and with the  latest release of windows 10 has this capability called ijs which enable the eye muscle that the gaze can help to type like the two sides of the coin there are negative impacts of ai as well  bill gates ellen musk also tech giants in a way their views are pessimistic to say the least they warned against the potential of ai to replace humans in the workplace and ella masks even went as far as to claim that ai is the biggest existential threat to mankind because of the loss of a job when you think about a job or a career choice if a majority of the tasks that comprise that career choice is likely to be these vulnerable tasks then that is a career at risk in the future so what are the tasks that ai will find hard to do anything unpredictable anything that requires skills like creative thinking or empathy or interpersonal skills but its important to understand tomorrow whether google is there or not artificial intelligence is going to progress you know technology has just nature its that its going to evolve as  technology and in particular ai can in fact bring more empowerment more inclusiveness and at the same time it is important to be cleareyed about displacement and unintended consequences like any other technology and work both skills so that people can find the jobs of the future create new jobs also the policy decisions that help people as they go through this change people already unhappy because of machine learning artificial intelligence as they think  if theyre not innovative enough or not creative enough your job will be taking away by a lot of machines ai for business going to affect the future of work specifically there are jobs that are at more risk of being taken over by ai and automation there is very wide dissonance on this there are different reports that have been shared by  oxford study that says 47 of us jobs are at risk of automation over the next few years meanwhile the general population and workers think differently a recent study conducted by college actually identifies that 97 of workers believe that most jobs will be automated but not their own this suggests that the general public needs to be educated on which jobs are  susceptible to this risk which are not and businesses need to be aware of the forthcoming skills gap of course not all jobs are equal the oxford study that highlights this they examined 700 participants and found the generalist occupations that require creative knowledge or innovation are at least risk the same is true for occupations in education healthcare media and arts jobs on the flip side jobs like telemarketers junior lawyers accountants are at most risk in short there is a simple rule of thumb if your job is in some way predictable or routine the risk of automation is much higher if a job doesnt require innovation or creativity then the return on investment for companies is higher on machines than realtime employees machines are faster cant be distracted and can work 247 this is actually good for creative marketers because ai and automation can serve to augment their jobs rather than substituting them as impact of emerging technologies on the creative economy they stated that artificial intelligence is changing  creative content from beginning to end by 2030 ai will be able to write high school essays code in python composed top 40s chart songs and make creative videos but all of these advancements also come with risks and costs take a look at this report by the global commission on the future of work in the absence of effective transition policies many people will have to accept lower skilled and lower paying jobs highskilled workers are taking less cognitively demanding jobs displacing less educated workers and this is already happening also technological dividends are being unevenly distributed among firms a very limited amount of companies tend to dominate when it comes to big data just think about google and facebook today they alone are responsible for 70 of the referral marketing traffic and  receive more than 50 of total global advertising budget so the question is in businesses workers and social institutions go into the same direction if companies and public policy leaders can understand the evolving landscape they can help the workforce anticipate the upcoming challenges technology and the demographic changes are leading to a smaller workforce compared to the previous generation and a workforce that has to pursue many careers during their time of work we need to provide workers with an environment where they can continuously upskill and grow governments will have to reevaluate the educational system we will have to continuously learn and grow and companies will have to redesign their structure and their culture around technology just like during the industrial revolution we are heading into a new age and the great transformation that were about to see by 2022 it is estimated that 20 to 25 percent of the labor force will be displaced within 10 to 20 years however this is also an opportunity for people to get ahead for which different ways have to be find to attract and retain highly skilled workers and allow them the time to up skill themselves even during work hours and it is a  good way  to develop a learning community to benefit from each other and also to use technology to supplement goal tracking and  efforts instead of as a distraction in short what we are doing is  to bridge the dissonance and it is imperative to build a  map of how ai and automation will affect  industry and  company if this is an economic imperative how do people feel about committing itself to a lifelong approach to knowledge as  these risks are important but it is important to do things like from being upfront to have ethical charters like ai safety and to be very transparent and open and how we perceive progress there and figure out global frameworks by which we can engage just like paris agreement and climate change by using  such forums bring people together as they engage on the hard questions and it will emerge answers and on the question of whether ai is a threat or not artificial intelligence is not  a threat because there is a rare case where people need to be proactive in regulation instead of reactive because i think by the time we are reactive in ai regulation its too late right now we have machine learning algorithms that can solve an incredibly complex problem beyond any human intelligence  as they are mere machines that can be given enormous data set and they come up with brilliant correlations and insights but theyre not going threaten the human population anytime soon because fish intelligent isnt terrible but human being a smart enough to learn that skills at least to have a complete toolbox to be prepared volatility of the future adaptability\n",

      "furthermore with most of the people staying indoors because of the lockdown majority of the department stores shops restaurants and food outlets are closed making an online purchase and food delivery are quite high this has created more consumption and demand for fossil fuels due to the transportation and mobility of these goods to each individual there has been an enormous upsurge of medical waste because most of the products employed by healthcare professionals are usually singleuse items that can be used only once before they are disposed of some of these wastes include used masks personal protection kits and gloves for instance nearly 200 tons of medical waste were generated during the peak of the pandemic breakout in wuhan china this is 50 tones more than the average waste generated before the outbreak in wuhan\n",

      "\n",
      "with recycling plants on hold piles of small mountains of wastes and their depositions at open areas are formed due to the increasing number of unrecycled wastes generated every day this makes the surrounding more vulnerable and also creating a high risk of air pollutions as the dumped open wastes decays into methane ch4 a greenhouse gas hence increasing the risk of global warming too  not only the surroundings are getting affected by these careless methods but the local people are also getting affected if the excess methane gets accumulated in the earths atmosphere due to piles of unrecycled wastes this could result in increases in earths average temperature and can be harmful to future generations\n",

      "some nations like china have asked the local authorities and native government bodies to increase the amount of disinfection routine mainly to increase the dosage of chlorine in the wastewater treatment plant to prevent the spread of the covid19 virus however according to who 2020 no solid evidence has been found on the survival of the virus on the lifespan of the virus in wastewater as well as in drinking water despite the fact that excessive amounts of chlorine in water can cause harmful problems and issues associated with peoples health like bladder cancer and it also damages its cells\n",
      "the covid19 is a reminder that the health of the planet is also linked to the health of humans evidence proves that the virus is zoonotic meaning it can be transmitted between people and animals they are accountable for seventyfive percent of all emerging infectious diseases in the world with the virus infecting millions of people every day across the globe various governments and agencies top priority is to regulate the spread of the virus by shifting the spotlight on the management and treatment of wastes especially the clinical and medical waste  likewise at the same time we as responsible individuals need to step up and follow the necessary guideline and precautions for the disposal of the waste and medical gears\n",

      "a lesserknown fact is that the covid19 outbreak was first detected in toronto canada nearly 7230 miles away from the first outbreak nine days before the who issued its warning it was with the help of big data analytics and ai more specifically deep learnings dl a subset of machine learning application in natural language processing nlp to analyze text inputs that traced the surge of pneumonia cases in the wuhan province of china the specialty of dl algorithms is that they mimic the brain cells called neurons and can identify patterns in big data this dlbacked software is used as inputs reports from public health organizations global airline ticketing data etc these were used to flag unusual surges and potential spreads of infectious diseases\n",
      "the next application of big data analytics and ai was in the research and development of drugs to halt covid19 ai was used to analyze the protein structure of the virus findings that were significant in the progress of vaccine development in preliminary studies it was found that it does not mutate as fast as other viruses such as hiv which means that a prophylactic vaccine is a better way to proceed rather than a therapy but there is also some evidence supporting the fact that when we find any kind of cure for it there is a chance of the virus mutating which is what happened and major mutations have been found in the uk brazil and south africa ai also assisted scientists in rapidly shortlisting a set of already available vaccines that could be effective against the coronavirus\n",
      "another interesting application of ai can be found in the selection of the right candidates ie most likely to test positive for testing coronavirus in case of insufficient testing resources this method was first exercised on greek borders and was called project eva whenever a traveler wanted to come into greece he had to fill out a form known as passenger locator form plf at least 24 hours prior to arrival containing information on their origin country demographics point and date of entry and the intended destination eva then allocated testing resources according to the size of the set of passengers to be tested after the test results if found positive they are put in quarantine the results were sent back to the program for realtime learning\n",
      "the question remains how eva made allocations it was found that statistically only the origin country and the city were significant factors for screening ultimately from a variety of countries and city pairs eva had to predict how many testing resources were to be allocated at each entry point and to particular passengers from a location is technically called the multiarmed bandit mab problem and the chosen method to solve this problem was an ai algorithm called optimistic gittins index this algorithm identified on average 185x as many asymptomatic infected travelers as random surveillance testing and up to 24x as many during peak travel after the test results if found positive they are put in quarantine following the collection of significant data through the aforementioned process after a certain period policies were made categorizing them separately and imposing restrictions on travelers from the specific location this eva as presented above was in operation from august 6th to november 1st processing around 38500 plfs each day and testing on an average 185 of households entering the country every day\n",
      "above mentioned applications just show the tip of the iceberg and there is more to get into some of the other developments to watch for include the use of image recognition to identify covid based on xray images the use of deep learning to predict the 3d protein structure associated with covid19 and so on\n",

      "what is the difference between artificial intelligence machine learning statistics and data mining\n",
      "\n",
      "data is the new oil has become the most important trendline of the 21st century the reason for this is the advancements in the fields related to data analysis the field of ai machine learning statistics and data mining all deal with data and are developing at such a staggering pace that these fields have become the most popular buzzwords these days\n",
      "buzzwords are originated through technical terms but often the underlying essence is ignored through fashionable use and mainly used to impress this is the main reason for the misconception amongst people ai ml stats data mining and many other fields related to the analysis of data are most often mistook for one and the same thing thus all these words are often used interchangeably to convey one and the same thing but this is not true at all\n",
      "the only similarity between these disciplines is that all of these disciplines are related to the analysis of the data and converting this data into information\n",
      "in academics while learning ai machine learning statistics and data mining the academic approach only wander in the technical definitions and concepts but the underlying essence and the aim of the discipline remain unexplored same is the case with most of the articles out there which try to explain the difference thus becoming the primary cause of confusion between learners hence this article explains the difference by explaining the philosophy and the aims of each of the disciplines rather than wandering in the technical definitions\n",
      "the essential difference between these disciplines lies in their aims and the approach taken to achieve those aims\n",
      "the aim of artificial intelligence is to understand intelligent entities then to satisfy this aim we must first understand what is intelligence and what makes an agent intelligent agent the answer to all these questions can be found by studying intelligent agents and the best example of an intelligent agent can be found by just standing in front of a mirror yes humans are the best examples of intelligent entities thus in the 1900s researchers began exploring the thought process the reasoning process of humans as human beings were considered as an ideal intelligent agent mimicking human behavior became the aim of ai in the initial years of the research after setting this goal studies and experiments began and the most famous experiment conducted in the initial years to achieve this aim was the turing test turing defined intelligent behavior as the ability to achieve humanlevel performance in all cognitive tasks sufficient to fool an interrogator but this test received criticism as only mimicking human behavior is not exactly intelligence because intelligence should be related to the working of the human brain as without the human brain intelligence has no meaning\n",
      "            thus mimicking human thought processes and reasoning became the transformed aim the field of psychology and philosophy also resonate with this aim that is to understand the human thought process the difference is that ai not only tries to understand the thought process but to mimic it build it the collaboration of these fields resulted in models such as neural networks which try to mimic the function of neurons present in the human brain so basically this initial aim was humancentered and humans were considered as the ideal intelligent agent\n",
      "concurrently the field of computer science was developing at a greater pace with the advances in computer science the experiments and theories could be easily tested and validated as programs were being applied to solve reallife problems it was found that computers performed better than humans at some tasks that are really complex for humans one of the best examples of this could be the chessplaying program an ai program defeated the worlds best chess player garry kasparov this incident indicated that human intelligence is not the ultimate intelligence or else a human would have been able to defeat the ai program this leads to a question is human intelligence the ideal intelligence\n",
      "as computers became more advanced they proved to be better than humans at certain complex tasks that is why the new definition of intelligence was being related to the ability to solve cognitive tasks or problems so rather than considering the nature of agents researchers began to study the nature of intelligence itself then the question comes how to test or validate intelligence the best way to test intelligence is to solve cognitive problems an agent can be said intelligent only if it can solve a complex problem the problemsolving approach can be easily tested and validated on computers thus some researchers began studying the ideal intelligence and the selected agent to validate the experiments was the computer so a computer and problemsolving approach were adopted so the humancentered approach and computer problemsolving approach are the two main aims of ai both of these fields have contributed to the field by giving valuable insights\n",
      "both the aims are important and both of these collaboratively form the main aim of ai\n",
      "in the problemsolving approach there is a big challenge that ai has to overcome in order to achieve its aim consider the example of solving a math problem there are two cases by which intelligence can be tested in this problemsolving approach let us say two math problems are given for you to solve the first problem is familiar to you and the second problem is not\n",
      "consider the first problem the first problem is familiar to you that means you know how to solve such kind of problems as you have already solved some similar problems in the past so there comes a question how our mind is able to solve that problem the answer is that you have solved similar problems in the past thus you have learned from the past data how to solve such problems thus even if you havent seen that problem in the past you will still be able to solve similar problems this is one form of intelligence\n",
      "consider another case where you are given a second problem where you have not solved such kind of problems in the past then to solve this problem you will try to consciously gather and manipulate the given information so that you reach a certain conclusion this kind of approach does not necessarily rely on the past data but completely on the reasoning process this is the second kind of intelligence\n",
      "for ai to build intelligent agents both of these kinds of intelligence must be developed in the agent but the reality is that ai has reached the point where it is able to build agents which can only learn from past data and find some useful information ai today has not reached a point where it can build agents who can think on their own that is the second type of intelligence\n",
      "so the way ai is able to implement the first type of intelligence is through machine learning so the domain of ai which focuses solely on implementing the first kind of intelligence is in fact machine learning that is the reason why ml is called the subset of ai so this is the main difference between ai and ml\n",
      "technically speaking it is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn from past data and find some meaningful conclusions patterns without being explicitly programmed this statement needs some elaboration the essence of ml is related to the process of generalization and learning from past data generalization is an abstraction by which common properties of specific instances are formulated as general concepts or claims consider how we humans recognize daily life objects if we see an animal then we can easily recognize if it is a dog or a cat it is a very trivial task for us but have you ever wondered how our mind is able to do it the answer is generalization\n",
      "if you were given a picture of a dog you can easily recognize that it is a picture of a dog because our minds have abstracted the description of a dog and formulated it into a concept of what a dog is and these concepts became better and better as we learned from the past experiences of a dog so the way we think is dependent on the fact that things are represented as generalized concepts in our minds\n",
      "with generalization only can come real information so we try to give computers the ability to generalize the raw data and convert it into information which can be patterns and trends in the data on their own\n",
      "this is the discipline that concerns the collection organization analysis interpretation and presentation of data statistics tries to deal with data with the only aim that is to explain it so it is the study of explaining the data itself statistics has two main domains which are descriptive statistics and inferential statistics\n",
      "descriptive statistics deals with the explanation or description of data thus the name descriptive statistics it tries to explain as much information as possible easily about the whole large data which would be a very complex task otherwise\n",
      " inferential statistics try to make accurate inferences from the available small data we use inference in many tasks in our daily lives consider a simple case of cooking a soup after completing the recipe you will taste a small sample that is a spoonful of the soup to check if the soup tastes good or bad depending upon the result of the sample you make an inference about the whole soup that if the soup as a whole good or bad similarly in statistics there are cases where you have to apply inference to have meaningful information for example consider a case where you cannot gather the whole data because it is very timeconsuming and costly in these cases applying inference based on the available sample introduces uncertainty that is where inferential statistics come for help\n",
      "so the use of data in the context of uncertainty and decisionmaking in the face of uncertainty is what statistics deals with so however and whatever the data statistics tries to explain that data this aim does not resonate with that of ai and ml but statistics help these fields to correctly interpret the data\n",
      "data is not useful at all in its raw form consider examples of sensors used in industrial applications these sensors might be used in a manufacturing plant to sense different properties like temperature pressure etc the raw data generated by these sensors are not useful until and unless it is converted to a suitable form then processed analyzed to gather valuable insights which can be used to solve a problem\n",
      "due to its unique aim of capturing the essence of very large datasets to gather insights data mining is also referred to as knowledge discovery that is why carly fiorina former ceo of hewlettpackard once said the goal is to turn data into information and information into insight this statement completely explains the aim of data mining\n",

      "\n",
      "will we ever understand the nature of consciousness\n",
      "\n",
      "introduction\n",
      "the definition of consciousness has been controversial for centuries hence it is given the title of the most familiar and yet mysterious aspects of our lives an idea of this concept would be an awareness in beings of their surroundings themselves and their own perception the reason this part of our mind remains unascertained is that consciousness isnt observable unlike brain matter that is studied scientifically the physical clarification of awareness is in a general sense incomplete it doesnt include what it feels to be the subject for the subject there likewise is by all accounts an unbridgeable illustrative gap between the physical world and our consciousness as suggested by an incident of eastern and shamir traditions consciousness is both universal and primal whilst we have made tremendous progress in understanding brain activity over the years this research hasnt been able to answer all the questions relating to the nature of emotions and experiences\n",
      "history\n",
      "beginning within the late nineteenth century this was a time that once had psychological queries driven by a philosophical understanding of the mind which was typically equated with consciousness as a result the analysis of brain and behavior naturally thought of the role of consciousness in behavioral management by the brain\n",
      "the ancient mayans were among the first to propose a sorted out feeling of each degree of consciousness its purpose and its worldly association with mankind since consciousness incorporates stimuli from nature as well as interior stimuli the mayans trusted it to be the most essential type of existence equipped for evolution the incas however thought about consciousness as a movement of mindfulness as well as of worry for others too\n",
      "john locke an early philosopher said that consciousness and so individuality are freelanced of all substances he also detected that there is no reason to believe that consciousness is stuck to any specific body or mind or that consciousness cannot be transferred from one body or mind to a different one karl marx another early thinker denies the mindbody classification and holds that consciousness is jeopardized by the material eventualities of ones settings william james an american psychologist differentiated consciousness to a stream  unbroken and continuous despite several changes and shifts\n",
      "while the main center of a lot of the analysis moved to strictly note cable behaviors throughout the primary half of the twentieth century analysis of human consciousness has grown staggeringly after the 1950s\n",
      "in sigmund freuds psychoanalytic theory we can see that he believed that all three levels of awareness preconscious conscious and unconscious were responsible for ones behavior and thinking he believed that the mid itself was divided into three parts the id the ego and the superego the id is present at birth instinctual and operates according to the pleasure principle the ego underseals reality and logic and develops out of the id in infancy finally the superego is an internalization of societys moral standards and responsible for guilt now the id is regarded as unconscious whereas the ego and superego are also conscious and preconscious freud constantly revised his own clinical qualities researches however and didnt conduct scientific experiments and hence his work is heavily scrutinized leaving the questions unanswered  \n",
      "sigmund freuds theory differed from the other psychologists since his theories were more understandable and very easily conveyed to the people sigmund freuds work and hypotheses helped people shape their perspectives on youth character memory sexuality and therapy however his theories were subject to considerable criticism both now and during his own life whilst john locke and william james took a more practical approach to the mystery by conducting experiments sigmund freud didnt provide any evidence to support his claims\n",
      "brain\n",
      "today the essential focal point of consciousness research is on understanding what consciousness implies both biologically and mentally issues of interest include phenomena such as perception blindsight brainwaves during sleep and altered states of consciousness produced by psychoactive drugs\n",
      "a greater part of the test assesses consciousness by approaching human subjects for a verbal report of their encounters however to confirm the criticalness of these verbal reports researchers must contrast them with the action that all the while happens in the brain that is they should search for the neural connections of consciousness\n",
      "hope is to locate that noticeable action in a specific aspect of the brain or a particular pattern of global brain activity will be greatly predictive of consciousness mindfulness a few brain imaging strategies for example eeg and mri scans have been utilized for physical proportions of brain activities in these examinations\n",
      "a few investigations have shown that movement in essential primary sensory areas of the brain isnt adequate to create consciousness it is workable for subjects to report an absence of awareness in any event when areas for example the primary visual cortex show clear electrical reactions to a stimulus higher brain areas are viewed as all the more encouraging particularly the prefrontal cortex which is involved in a range of high order functions\n",
      "one mainstream theory implicates various examples of brain waves in creating various conditions of consciousness analysts can record mind waves or drawings of electrical movement inside the cerebrum using an electroencephalograph eeg and placing electrodes on the scalp the four types of brain waves alpha beta theta and delta each correspond with one mental state relaxed alert lightly asleep and deeply asleep\n",
      "memory\n",
      "episodic memory can be regarded as the only form of conscious memory this is because it is the capacity to consciously remember personally experienced events and situations in the past the hippocampus located in the brains temporal lobe is responsible for this type of memory\n",
      "consciousness also plays a part in important memory distinctions one such distinction is the implicit and explicit characteristics in which explicit memory is what you consciously know and implicit memory includes events you may not be conscious of\n",
      "furthermore several empirical findings suggest that declarative memory is related to consciousness as well meaning that the retrieval and formation of this memory are connected to awareness working memory operatesmaintains consciously perceived information as well since it temporarily stores and tampers with information whilst working on tasks\n",
      "the current ways of testing this information are lacking in several essential aspects including spatial resolution temporal resolution or scope examples of such methods are pet fmri eeg implanted electrodes etc\n",
      "pet and fmri have temporal resolution problems eeg is wellknown to have localizability difficulties and implanted electrodes whilst great in temporal and spatial resolution can only test a set number of neurons that is they are restricted in scope hence huge numbers of our speculations while testable on a fundamental level appear to be difficult to test as of now\n",
      "mental illness\n",
      "consciousness has an influence on the way we see objects around us which encourages us to settle on choices about how to communicate with them experiencing difficulty perceiving objects is connected to a few problems for example agnosia a failure to decipher visual data alzheimers disease and autism however we actually dont comprehend what visual data is basic for the mind to intentionally perceive an object\n",
      "several different disorders of consciousness include lockedin syndrome minimally conscious state persistent vegetative state chronic coma and brain death\n",
      "lockedin syndrome otherwise called pseudo coma is a condition wherein a patient is aware however cant move or impart verbally because of complete loss of motion of essentially all voluntary muscles in the body aside from vertical eye developments and squinting the individual is conscious and is able to speak with eye movements\n",
      "in a minimally conscious state the patient has intermittent periods of awareness and wakefulness patients need to give restricted however reproducible indications of consciousness of themself or their current circumstance this could be following straightforward orders comprehensible speech or purposeful conduct\n",
      "in a persistent vegetative state the patient has sleepwake cycles but lacks awareness is not able to communicate and only displays reflexive and nonpurposeful behavior the term refers to an organic body that is able to grow and develop devoid of intellectual activity or social intercourse\n",
      "like coma chronic coma results generally from cortical or whitematter harm after neuronal or axonal injury or from central brainstem sores usually the metabolism in the grey matter decreases to 5070 of the normal range the patient lies with eyes shut and doesnt know about self or environmental factors\n",
      "brain death is the irreversible end of all brain activity and function including involuntary activity necessary to sustain life the main cause is total necrosis of the cerebral neurons following loss of brain oxygenation after brain death the patient lacks any sense of awareness sleepwake cycles or behavior and typically look as if they are dead or are in a deep sleep state\n",
      "future predictions and conclusion\n",
      "as we can see from the history of scholars endeavors to study consciousness empirically its nature is not one that can be defined using scientific methods in the past psychologists such as descartes came up with dualistic theories that did not line up with the fundamental laws of physics in the battle between realists and illusionists taking sides is fundamentally impossible as the topic doesnt allow for concrete evidence\n",
      "as we can observe from neural examinations of the brain to detect the causes of consciousness there is no sensory sector of the brain that is the cause for one to be aware during a certain event even if there are clear signs of a reaction to a stimulus similarly even though consciousness plays a major role in memory we currently lack the facilities to research it fully in the future there is a possibility that we will be able to access such facilities however which could allow us to find the neural connections and its ties to mental illness as well not only would this help several people by making us aware of the causes of our perspective on certain things but it would also give us a better chance of recognizing signs of possible mental illness or other issues beforehand\n",
      "as it seems researchers continue to study this unknown part of our mind and once we are able to fund and recover from the global pandemic we will be able to answer one of psychologys most difficult questions\n",

      "\n",
      "nature has blessed humanity with earth a rounded globe where all essential necessity lies in the hand of a human though in this 21stcentury building space shuttle and exploring space has become an obvious activity among the human raise now with the inclusion of startups like space x once dreamed for reaching out at space now is coming true we all have to agree upon a fact that in the growth of industrialization we have generated a humungous carbon footprint and colonize at outer space will create a muchneeded area for our survival\n",
      "with time the human race has visualized and has undergone many transformations and these transformations may for starters were not that effective but were a major role at existence to this age be it a natural transformation like shifting of tectonic plates or manmade like dumping water and damaging water bodies somehow have affected usual life of humans so creating space of humans is what next humans are eyeing for\n",
      "all this idea for colonizing in outer space emerged when nasa was able to launch a space shuttle with a heavy payload in the late 1990s this idea didnt stir brain at that time but later was like apple eyes when various articles from astronauts and their writeup came into limelight and this idea saw its progression space exploration was not a new normal companies were petrified by the number of investments that these kinds of projects ask for but things change with the entry of paypals owner elon musk in 2002 where he laid stones of space x with nasa providing the launchpad for their exploration\n",
      "being space travel legitimate there where many bottlenecks knowing the nature of outer space will boost the idea of colonizing here one has to realize the optimum but the main target that these company put forward with themself was to not just get into other planet but to get back at earth safely earlier these projects due to high fund was always subdued and priority was given to the rocket technology thus this unimaginable quest for the search of space was farfetched though\n",
      "now being in 2020 we do not find it out of a place of colonizing outside of space the kind of emergence of technologies has led to the escalation of spreading the roots of human existence the plan for reaching out to outer space too plays a key role for this idea too proper planning analysing organising and executing were required for these projects to be successful for deeper know how i would like to mention here an example of space x according to them they wud be successful for sending rockets by 2022 and would able to colonize by 2050 for achieving these vision they have planned a total of 36 times prelaunch of the same rocket which they will be launching by 2020 not only that they have already placed their star link satellites which will provide the basic network connectivity for their colonized world they have planned this to that extent that they have targeted a profit of  22 billion yearly by 2025 already they have sent the first manned rocket successfully what elon musk plan is to create that infrastructure by which going to mars with cost as a regular air flight ticket all this will lead to better chances for colonizing at another planet with setting up their commercial flight once started to the red planet it wud just be a stepping stone for the colonizing at the outer space\n",
      "but the fundamental change that people have to undergo while living on another planet will be a change in gravity and being able to be near to live support if any technical issues arise to their suit until unless we find a similar place like the earth that is the change which humans have to adjust aspects like ultraviolet rays too will play an immense role in the survival but with the rate of technology expanding and challenging at very boundaries there are not many days left when we find solutions to these aspects but this idea of colonizing has more to do with monetary terms it has been projected that building a colony at space will cost at about 10 trillian which is more than many countries gdp placing that much of an amount and getting funding for such highly anticipated projects is tough elon to have addressed with these questions with an open door he believes that this cost is nothing when we find a route to colonize space and these costs will be justifiable when space exploration will reach new heights\n",
      "also our world is around water and the percentage of land comparison to water is too less whereas the population is increasing with the speed and the level of excitement in order to search for new things and the obsession with the new and innovative things never going to finish because in the end we do not satisfy what we have achieved we are only looking for other things and crave to achieve that\n",
      "in order to achieve that planning is most crucial stage as of now we have searched 9 planets but still didnt shortlisted the outcomes but according to the 3decade theory of elon musk it seems to be possible\n",
      "as the most important thing to survive is the atmospheric environment whether is this suitable or not and in order to make it suitable what steps had to take and maintain the suitable level of oxygen  the missions are now what everyone is focusing about finding the source of water because its 2nd crucial thing which is needed to survive\n",
      "apart from the excitement and the things the threats or the uncertainties are bound to happen like any kind of mammal which could occur during construction or after that so the security for that or any protection so that uncertainties could be replicated\n",
      "after the basic things other factors like what are the natural habitats available there whether the plants could be grown over there or not if yes then what types of plants could survive there\n",
      "the environment for the animals is safe or not because to balance the nature we need all types of animals natural habitat even insects and other small things which seems to be ignorable but plays an important role in maintaining the environmental balance for eg   ants are among the leading predators of other insects helping to keep pest populations low  ants move approximately the same amount of soil as earthworms loosening the soil in the process and increasing air and water movement into the ground  they keep the ecosystem clean of dead insect carcasses and aid in the destruction and decomposition of plant and animal matter so every small thing contributes in its own way\n",
      "another matter of concern is the level of artificial intelligence and machine learning required to maintain that kind of requirement because as the current scenario we need energy to run any vehicle or even for the robotics so the availability of the energy and the source of energy is needed\n",
      "and apart from this the heat of sun is equally important in order to maintain the level because with artificial air we can survive but not for so long so in order to remain healthy as well the calculation has to be done when thinking about disease you may have heard in the news about the concern that antibiotics such as penicillin  which help fight infections  may eventually stop working global health organisations are trying to reduce the use of antibiotics especially for conditions that arent serious this is because their overuse in recent years means that theyre becoming less effective\n",
      "but still we can survive without antibiotics because there are ways of dealing with diseases caused by bacteria such as isolation which is how they were treated before penicillin\n",
      "it might sound like something set firmly in the realm of fantasy but experts in private industry and governments around the world are trying to understand how feasible it would be to establish a lunar base some scientists think humans could survive comfortably on the moon in some ways the very minimal gravity of the moon might actually be more conducive to life than the microgravity astronauts experience on the international space station\n",
      "although it hasnt been formally tested some experts hypothesize that the small amount of gravitational force put on an astronauts body when on the moon could help stem some of the adverse effects like bonedensity and muscle loss that space flyers experience while living in microgravity on the international space station\n",
      "by using the moons indigenous material space agencies can save money on the cost of flying pricey missions to and from the moons surface once on the moon instead of having to stage costly missions aimed at delivering oxygen and other necessary resources from earth experts might be able to actually use the material to manufacture gasses needed to sustain life on the satellite\n",
      "on earth we are protected from radioactive solar winds and cosmic rays by our own magnet field known as the magnetosphere but out in the space we cant rely on this type of protection and in order to make that protection it could take a lot but yes with more upgraded technology it could achieve\n",
      "although till now the approximate value of the project is 10 trillion but the aim is to make the fare equivalent to the normal air fare\n",
      "as once we are comfortable with all the resources securities for uncertainties risk analysis and the probability of survival of the human being and many other factors after consideration then development wont take much time\n",
      "because to construct a building it take normally 89 months which is totally acceptable\n",
      "but the main concern is the density of the land ie whether the land has the capacity to bear that much weight or not and the type of land is adaptable for cultivation or nor although land can be converted into different types of cultivation but with the help of upgraded technology\n",
      "in order to transport the equipments on the regular basis a large amount of fuel is required and other factors as well and built the propellor depo for rocket landing building various infrastructure for the city one by one will create a way forward for idea of colonizing at outer space\n",

      "why does your business need a chatbot\n",
      "\n",
      "mr sakamoto is a bonsai artist lives downtown kyoto japan bonsai is a japanese art form that is the cultivation of small trees in a small or medium container he is in this field of business for the last ten years and he loves what he does on a daily basis people from different cities in japan come to buy his artwork but in the early stage of his business he was just another regular bosai artist his popularity has increased because of the stories he tells for every art he is selling his customer immediately loved him for this while buying a bonsai art he loved to sell his customer with his artwork and a story related to that product which resurrects his presence through his art in customers soon enough his business thrived and nowadays he is always busy after the digital revolution although his sales increased he was not happy he was not satisfied something is eating up his mind day by day he could not understand whats the reason behind his remorse\n",
      "a chatbot is an awesome invention of the digital revolution it is the reallife embodiment of customer engagement every business needs this feature will be an understatement because customer engagement is the base of any business the chatbot does the exact thing digitally it helps customers to answer the queries and tell about the product that the business has to offer is a fully automated way with vibrant customizations\n",
      "            mr sakamoto is running his business for the last fifteen years now and now he is happy that he was not for the past couple of years the rationale behind his happiness is the chatbot though he has a website and app to sell his bonsai art he could not engage with the customers in the way he wanted to he has trained his employees and apprentices but they are not providing the same service in the way he does he was unsatisfied and the chatbot relives him from his sadness he has done all that at affordable prices in no time\n",
      "lets understand the mr sakamotos mondai nai perspective about why chatbot is the answer of his problems\n",
      "this is the fundamental and root cause for which mr sakamoto has to implement the chatbot in the first place his stories are embedded with each art the product which he sells needs this story to be with it his stories which were not been told to all the customers before are now sharing with this chatbot and building the trust between them we all can agree on this one statement that trust is the most impactful aspect maybe the best of aspects in the relation between any customer and businessowner whether the business is small medium or large\n",
      "millennials a word that was not introduced before 1990 the generation which is stuck in between genx and geny a generation of people accustomed to both digitization and old culture they are the most targeted audience in this era what else would be more approachable to this generation than a chatbot its easy less time consuming to use mr sakamoto is now one of the few genx persons who can do business with the millennial so easily\n",
      "mr sakamoto has some employees and apprentices he has trained them as per his needs but there is a limit they cant deliver the exact things that he can or the way he does neither chatbot can do that exactly it will accurately follow the instructions not only the chatbot solve the queries of the customer in his way but also give a recommendation to the product in the way he wants too is there any more attribute he would care about that absolutely no\n",
      "the most expensive thing for any businessman is the return of their customer with an empty hand because of his unavailability a chatbot is a perfect way to solve it for mr sakamotos customized chatbot is not only present for customers in their availability but also it was giving the response to the customer in all the time zone all over the world mr sakamoto wouldnt be happier for this feature\n",
      "in the era of globalization what is more helpful than a chatbot it can be customized in any language it can be accessed by any human being residing in any part of the world and at the end of the day when that foreigner is happy with the buy and the felicitation and says arigato but in his own language at that moment he feels so warm and happy\n",
      "handling a lot of customers is really hard he assigned employees but the rate is growing fast so in the competition of the market mr sakamoto took the help of a chatbot now this automated customized application is handling a greater number of customers than his employees can do his business is growing exponentially\n",

      "\n",
      "have you ever wondered whats common between sir alex ferguson pep guardiola and jose mourinho i know it might look a lame question especially to the ardent football followers at first instinct the answer is that they are regarded as the top managers in the football universe but when given a closer look these managers werent that great when it came to their careers as football players any naïve observer can build a fallacy of causation and correlation that those who dont have a great career as a football player will go on to become a great football manager but is this restricted just to football mike brearley one of the greatest captains in the history of cricket and the author of the book the art of captaincy wasnt the prolific batsman of his time our former president a p j abdul kalam didnt have a political background but was still appointed as the president of our country and went to become one of the finest presidents our country has ever had so can it be stated with confidence that great leaders need not be the expert in their respective fieldslets understand the leadership role types of leaders and explore a few more perspectives before we arrive at a conclusion \n",
      "lets start by first understanding what or who is a leader a leader is not a position or a designation its a virtue if employed correctly from a janitor to the ceo from a student to a researcher from a content writer to a philosopher everybody is a leader leadersareeverywhere so what are the virtues of a leader one of the famous personality trait theories the big 5 personality trait theory is always linked closely with leadership as per the various researches the personality traits of extraversion openness and conscientiousness are associated with leaders more often than the other two traits not just these humble and empathetic are also considered as the adjectives that are frequently associated with leaders but nowhere is technical expertise related to a leader\n",
      "as stated by colin powell leadership is the art of accomplishing more than the science of management says is possiblesart if leadership is an art and leaders are the artists then more or less the leaders can be viewed as directors of the films who are organizing arranging managing and directing the scenes another analogy for that can be the orchestra where the conductor is using the batonstick to set the rhythm of the band so is it necessary for the conductor to himself or herself by a great violinist no when it comes to the corporate sector the leader need not be an expert on the technology but should know how the technology functions so that heshe can utilize it in the best possible way they can allocate the task of building technology to the right technical experts and how do the leaders identify the right person for that job or how do leaders know what qualities to look for in a person every great leader once started off as one of the frontline workers or at the bottom of the pyramid in the hierarchical structure even though they might not have had the technical expertise in their respective fields their visionary outlook their management skills and the experience they gathered helped them in achieving their targets leaders can always take the assistance of the subject matter experts to guide them in situations of technical difficulties as per the great man situational and trait theory of leadership leadership is innate to the person leadership though can be conditioned or can be brought out in a person by rewarding him great leaders show unconditional attachment towards their vision everyone knows how to read a map but which path to choose isnt something that can be taught leaders give the direction or vision to the company and drive it closer to the target that the company wants to achieve leadership theories dont focus on the technical knowledge of the leaders but rather more on people skills their approach towards a problem and how well they guide and hire others to get the job done which is also evident as per the managerial skills required as per robert katz\n",
      "though it can be argued that technical experts are also the great leaders in their areas but these leaders are generally at the middle management level as per the different leadership styles a servant leader is the one who always tries to achieve the goal of the team these leaders are the ones who have a management objective laid out in front of them and they drive the team closer to achieving the target by having the peoplefirst mindset a collaborative approach towards solving the problem these are the people or the leaders needed at the execution level of the project or those who are too close to the employees at the bottommost level since the managers at the top of the pyramid dont get much time to invest in people they appoint the right people on their behalf to get the job done  \n",
      "consider an it firm so as per the points mentioned above does it mean that a leader or the manager shouldnt know how to code depends if the person is the first line manager then he or she should probably know how to code so that he or she can help the team in achieving the target of producing less garbage which might be one of the projects kpis the project manager who might be an operations manager mba from an it background probably need not know what line of code is to be written but should know the algorithms or the logic behind the code so that he or she can validate the code from the clients perspective the ceo might not be from an it background but should know how to run an it firm rather than the syntax of the code\n",
      "but in todays competitive world leaders cant be one dimensional they need to have expertise in multiple areas to be at the top mike brearley if got a chance to play a t20 match wont even get picked into aside not because of his age but because of his not so great looking batting statisticsthegamehaschanged his leadership skills wont be enough to get him into the squad but he can be a great leader if selected to coach the top 15 captains in the world today as we have already discussed the film directors their job isnt to teach the cameramen on how to set up or operate lens settings etc the camera their job is to guide the cameramen on what angle it should be held and how he or she should coordinate with the lights crew so that a perfect shot is captured so even if a leader may not be a technical expert of his field but if he or she has the right approach and mindset understands the system and its process then he or she can hire the best talent for the job and can get the work done by guiding the talent with his or her vision\n",
      "so the answer to the question which we came across in the first paragraph is yes and no depending upon the position in the hierarchy yes for a frontline manager and no for a cxo and the type of the leader you are the level of technical expertise needed varies though as stated earlier by robert katz the cxos need to have the least amount of technical expertise the cxo should know how the technology functions or what are the applications what processes are to be followed to build the technology  he or she should now what is to be done rather than how it is to be done itsnothowitswhat otherwise even though the company might be sitting on a gold mine but if the leader isnt aware of that or isnt learned enough to know what to do with it no company can succeed even with having all the resources at their disposal leaders command respect and dont demand it and thats possible when they give value to their frontline employees seek timely advice from the technical experts and put the resources to the best of its uses otherwise you will be surrounded by technical experts like dilberts dilbert\n",

      "in my point of view we cannot become a good leader without technical expertise because every task in the organization its required a lot of skills knowledge consistent enthusiastic patience motivating inspiring industrious and critical thinking on the basis of the field we are doing a leader should have the ability to motivate self and others effective oral and written communication critical thinking skills at the working team and delegating a task good leaders do have these abilities and if we wanted to create a future leader they need to take in a large volume of information and to take the essential elements that define the core problem to solve they need to organize a team to solve these problems and to communicate to a group they need to established trust with a group and use the trust to allow the team to accomplish the work more than it could be done alone though all these skills we have but its would not sufficient to make us a great leader because to excel and utilize these abilities in practice we need a lot of technical expertise in a particular domain for example like in a hospital if the head of the hospital is lead by other people rather than doctor then the hospital would become worse at a point because the person from other fields he could not lead and understand the real scenario and mechanism that the hospital is functioning and he would not understand the staff and the patient as well hence to lead the hospital doctor is deserved who knows his own field how to lead and understand the real scenario of it thats why being a leader requires technical expertise to have great knowledge and understanding about his own organization every person if they want to become a leader they should have technical expertise on their own organization so that their organization would run smoothly hence nobody could run other organization if we do not have the technical expertise on that field\n",

      "when we talk about the effect of ai in the environment and climate both sides of the coin must be elucidated so apart from all the positives discussed above the usage of ai also has a downside\n",
      "last years world economic forum report showed that while ai can address some of earths environmental challenges it is important to manage it properly according to the forum and experts in the field ai has the potential to accelerate environmental degradation the use of powerintensive gpus to run machine learning training has already been cited as contributing to increased c02 emissions\n",

      "the key however is for ai developers and companies to know how much their machine learning experiments are spewing and how much those volumes could be reduced\n",
      "what can be done\n",
      "to prevent this the proposition by the world economic forum report is that advancements in safe ai should be pursued to ensure that humanity is not developing ai that is harmful to the environment specifically the world economic forum said in its report that ai developers must incorporate the health of the natural environment as a fundamental dimension this means safeguarding against models that will demand the consumption of energy or natural resources beyond what is sustainable among other factors in a sense all programs need to be designed with the dimension of environmental protection and improvement in mind\n",
      "in the future development of ai programs it will also be important to note the environmental impact of creating these systems in the first place according to an academic study on energy usage for deep learning processes the creation of an effective ai might be costly to the environment nearly 300000 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions are created during the process of training a single model this is basically equal to the emissions of five average cars in the united states considering the negative environmental impact in addition to the positive implications of ai and climate change will be crucial moving forward\n",

      "let us start with manish understand that the task is to get their jobs done manish has two options here he can either order parts and assemble it himself or order the material required such as wood glue nails etc and then work on it before the assembly of the final product the only difference is his lack of expertise in this field\n",
      "vinay has the same options but has practical experience from his carpentry classes during the workshop in engineering sameer has an advantage since he has both skill and experience perfected over a course of time\n",

      "manish and vinay wait for a day for the parts to come they begin to work on the second day manish uses the tricks learned from youtube videos uses a hammer to place the nails purchased from a nearby shop in the premade hole applies glue in certain areas as directed in the video and places weight on the assembled stool he waits for the glue to cure\n",
      "vinay uses borrowed drill bits drill machines cutters sandpapers purchased from a shop etc and starts working on the wooden parts as soon as the parts arrive in the morning he is able to recall his carpentry instructions and attempts to shape the parts based on drawing of his product he made last night sameer meanwhile has completed his assembly and has put the assembly to rest for the glue to cure\n",

      "this led to a huge increase in the defaulters of borrowers and ultimately banks had to auction houses to gain credit back with the highinterest rates and no one to buy the auctioned houses this ultimately caused a chain reaction and banks were no longer receiving credit the prices of real estate started falling drastically and people with good credit scores who had earlier taken housing loans also started defaulting because the price of their houseshomes fell below the loan amount that they had taken earlier banks stopped receiving money and also because of this chain reaction the value of cdos ultimately came down to 0\n",

      "our culture glorifies fearlessness the traditional image of a leader is one who is smart tough and unafraid but fear like any emotion has an evolutionary purpose and upside your concern about making mistakes is there to remind you that were in a challenging situation a cautious leader has value this is especially true in times like these so dont get caught up in ruminating i shouldnt be so fearful\n",
      "dont be ashamed or afraid of your fear of making mistakes and dont interpret it as evidence that youre an indecisive leader or not bold not visionary if you have a natural tendency to be preventionfocused channel it to be bold and visionary if you struggle to believe this identify leaders who have done just that by figuring out how to prevent disasters\n",
      "fear of mistakes can paralyze people emotional agility skills are an antidote to this paralysis this process starts with labeling your thoughts and feelings such as i feel anxious im not going to be able to control my customers enough to keep my staff safe stating your fears out loud helps diffuse them its like turning the light on in a dark room next comes accepting reality for example i understand that people will not always behave in ideal ways list off every truth you need to accept then comes acting your values lets say one of your highest values is conscientiousness how might that value apply in this situation for example it might involve making sure your employees all have masks that fit them well or feel comfortable airing any grievances they have identify your five most important values related to decisionmaking in a crisis then ask yourself how each of those is relevant to the important choices you face\n",
      "repeat this process for each of your fears it will help you tolerate the fact that we sometimes need to act when the course of action isnt clear and avoid the common anxiety trap whereby people try to reduce uncertainty to zero\n",
      "worrying can help you make better decisions if you do it effectively most people dont  when you worry it should be solutionsfocused not just perseverating on the presence of a threat direct your worry towards behaviors that will realistically reduce the chances of failure\n",
      "we can control systems not outcomes what are your systems and processes for avoiding making mistakes direct your worries into answering questions like these is the data youre relying on reliable what are the limitations of it how do your systems help prevent groupthink what procedures do you have in place to help you see your blind spots how do you ensure that you hear valuable perspectives from underrepresented stakeholders what are your processes for being alerted to a problem quickly and rectifying it if a decision has unexpected consequences\n",
      "when were scared of making a mistake our thinking can narrow around that particular scenario imagine youre out walking at night youre worried about tripping so you keep looking down at your feet next thing you know youve walked into a lamp post or imagine the person who is scared of flying they drive everywhere even though driving is objectively more dangerous when you open the aperture it can help you see your greatest fears in the broader context of all the other threats out there this can help you get a better perspective on what you fear the most\n",
      "it might seem illogical that you could reduce your fear of making a mistake by thinking about other negative outcomes but this strategy can help kick you into problemsolving mode and lessen the mental grip a particular fear has on you a leader might be so highly focused on minimizing or optimizing for one particular thing they dont realize that other people care most about something else find out what other peoples priorities are\n",
      "fear grabs us it makes it difficult to direct our attention away this is how it is designed to work so that we dont ignore threats some people react to fear with extreme hypervigilance they want to be on guard at their command post at all times this might manifest as behavior like staying up all night to work\n",
      "that type of adrenalinfueled behavior can have shortterm value but it can also be myopic a different approach can be more useful for bigger picture thinking we need leisure and sleep to step back integrate the threads of our thinking see blindspots and think creatively get some silent time although much maligned a game of golf might be exactly what you need to think about tough problems holistically\n",
      "as mentioned when people are fearful they can go into alwayson monitoring mode you may have the urge to constantly look at what everyone else is doing to always be on social media or check data too frequently this can result in information overload your mind can become so overwhelmed that you start to feel cloudy or shut down recognize if youre doing this and limit overmonitoring or overchecking avoid panicked frenzied behavior\n",
      "on its own being afraid of making mistakes doesnt make you more or less likely to make good decisions if you worry excessively in a way that focuses only on how bad the experience of stress and uncertainty feels you might make do or say the wrong things however if you understand how anxiety works at a cognitive level you can use it to motivate careful but bold and wellreasoned choices\n",

      "because of covid19 pandemic businesses have realized that more and more meetings can be handled over video calls thus the movement of business personnel will be restricted there will still be some representatives who will fly out to conduct business but the industry can expect a permanent drop in revenue from this sector\n",
      "moving over to the supply side the aviation and tourism industries face strong disruptions in their supply chain because the industry is a leisure expense manufacturing of many supporting equipment like the adventure sports gears and even parts of planes themselves has stopped because of the drop in demand it is going to be tough to get the supply chain back up again furthermore workers are afraid to show up to their jobs because of the high risk of contracting the virus due to exposure to multiple customers from different geographies\n",

      "hosts usually decide cancellation policy but under extreme circumstances like this one the company decided to override all existing policies many of whom werent strict and gave full refund to the guests the company got 2 billion loan and has helped out the owners financially by paying 25 for cancelled bookings capping at 5khost they have helped some hosts by getting them eligible for small business loans and avoid eviction\n",
      "thankfully there are too few properties to cause a housing crisis but breakdown could cause strain on lenders and undermine property values all want to sell to avoid foreclosure or defaulting on loans airdna states that the listing splitup for airbnb is 33 list single property 33 owners list 224 properties 33 hosts have 25 properties\n",
      "some state governments in america have banned shortterm rentals this hurt the airbnb owners because people looking to quarantine outside their homes or near relatives couldve generated revenues\n",
      "so what are hosts doing now\n",
      "many are discounting units and looking for longterm tenants 12 months many are planning to apply for a smallbusiness loan seek forbearance from banks find longterm tenants independently of airbnb and sell property\n",

      "\n",
      "the covid 19 pandemic has reshaped the fundamental fabric of our world initiating in china in late december 2019 the virus has since then spread to every corner of the world infecting millions in its wake countries around the world have responded by shutting down their economies and advocating lockdowns of varying degrees india has arguably had one of the most stringent lockdowns of all countries restricting the movement of people goods and effectively transforming every city into a ghost town\n",
      "due to such stringent restrictions on movement the economy has received a fatal blow the virus arrived in india at a time when the country was already in strife dealing with a slowing gdp growth rate and an everincreasing fiscal deficit the lockdown has simply exacerbated the economic predicament pushing multiple businesses and industries to a moribund state other countries have also faced a similar predicament particularly in the us and europe both being hotspots for virus transmission\n",
      "however upon taking a closer look at the global economy there seems to have been an upward mobilization in some of the sectors in the it domain these sectors seem to have exorbitantly increased their scale of operations and have overall reaped hefty profits so what is it that differentiates these areas from the rest and what can we learn from them\n",
      "if we look at the evolving itites industry around the world the domains that have flourished in this strenuous time all have had one key characteristic in common flexibility these sectors have adopted a more flexible approach to dealing with the lockdown be it flexible working procedures or adopting newer more advanced ways of working in line with the requirements of our time they havent shied away from changing the rules of the game lets look at some of these areas within the tech domain that have been successful in conquering the lockdown\n",
      "lockdowns around the globe have confined people inside their homes with nothing much to do of significance as a result social networking sites have reported a gigantic rise in user engagement over the lockdown period reportedly there has been close to a 50 rise in daily text transmissions across messaging platforms such as facebook instagram and whatsapp in the hardesthit economies twitter has reported a 23 increase in its user base as compared to last year the data makes it evident that social media platforms are here to reap the benefits of a lockdown situation\n",
      "video consumption sites such as youtube instagram and tiktok are in line to reap massive profits its no wonder that viewership on these platforms has increased manifolds due to lockdowns these platforms serve to be a distraction from the tragedies of the real world in such stressing times and offer an easy escape be it rumors regarding the cure for covid 19 gossips or rap battles these platforms provide viewers with their muchneeded dose of distractions as they say ignorance is bliss\n",
      "the lockdown has proven to be a miracle for datamining companies with such an exorbitant increase in the number of hours spent online globally these firms now have access to significantly larger sets of data than they otherwise could ever have widespread implementation of datamining has been seen recently with most countries opting for governmentregulated surveillance applications that monitor your movement at all times moreover these applications have access to your personal information as well as medical records countries such as south korea and singapore are at the helm of relying on such means to control the outbreak\n",
      "although noble such initiatives do raise a red flag with regards to user privacy the public has been provided with very little information about how these applications operate and what goes on behind the scenes this creates an atmosphere of obscurity that is frankly harmful to the premise of a democracy\n",
      "cloud computing\n",
      "cloud computing has been on the rise for the last couple of years however the pandemic has made it the de facto king in terms of computational services with an increasing reliance on remote working the ability to store data in one secure location has turned out to be critical\n",
      "the cloud computing services such as amazon web services microsoft azure and google cloud have reaped hefty profits in the process the emerging landscape in the tech world seems to suggest an upward trend in reliability on these services as far as large scale data storage and computing is concerned\n",
      "social distancing measures have made it practically impossible for people to physically go shopping for groceries and other necessities moreover a majority of retail outlets in cities have reported negligible engagement for the fear of transmission of the virus ecommerce sites have been the real winners in this predicament of global consumerism\n",
      "with high standards of hygiene and athome delivery these sites have provided an easy alternative to retail stores other similar businesses include food delivery apps and grocery sites that are also flourishing today amidst the pandemic recent weeks have made it evident that ecommerce websites are well on their way to abolish traditional shopping methods\n",
      "online streaming platforms consist of a relatively newer approach to entertainment having only been in existence for the past couple of years they had already however established a name for themselves before the lockdowns sites such as netflix and amazon prime had been dominating a chunk of the market share and competing heavily with movie theatres for new releases for a while now now with the lockdown practically deleting theatres and cable tv from the collective psyche of the entertainment industry they are well on their way to becoming the platform of choice as far as entertainment for the masses is concerned\n",
      "this has already become evident with zee5 india reporting a whopping 80 increase in subscriptions and a 50 increase in the time spent on their site within the first couple of weeks of the lockdown itself another such platform mubi reported a 28 rise in its viewership in india only a week after lockdown commenced these facts are a clear indication of the exponential growth that is in store for these platforms which is unlikely to change anytime soon\n",
      "the idea of working from home is all set to be the new norm in our professional culture which requires an easy and effective way to communicate over the internet not just audio or text but video conferencing is the need today hence its understandable why multiple video conferencing services are set to reap massive profits off of the new norm\n",
      "arguably the most popular of these zoom has reported a 130 increase in its price share since the beginning of 2020 another such platform known as the microsoft teams collaboration suite operated by microsoft has reported a whopping 12 million increase in its user base in the very first week of the lockdown in the us this data is only likely to have an upwards trajectory considering the increasing pace at which industries are going online\n",
      "the indian picture\n",
      "the indian it landscape has also undergone massive cultural changes according to rajesh gopinathan chief executive officer and managing director of tata consultancy services ltd the work from home model of operations is here to stay he also claimed that the firms only requires a 25 workforce to be physically present for any project at any of the locations\n",
      "tata consultancy services which is one of the major players in the indian it landscape has shifted almost 90 of its workforce into a remote borderless workspace model and other smaller firms have followed suit what it tells us is that were headed in a direction were unlikely to return from remote working appears to be the modern protocol for operations and is unlikely to change anytime soon\n",
      "however a major challenge often overlooked in such circumstances is that of an adaptable culture the culture of workspaces has to be drastically altered and members of the workforce have to dive headfirst into the new way of doing business this is critical to ensure that the industry can combat the pandemic and recover gloriously\n",
      "the lockdown has presented us with a stark contrast unlike any other weve witnessed where on the one hand the industries mentioned above seem to be exhibiting exponential growth with their people thriving and having every possible resource at their disposal the unorganized sector and the msmes micro small and medium enterprises seem to be at the crux of death\n",
      "the sector that consists of people for whom having guidelines to work from home is irrelevant as that was never really an option people with no fixed wages or social security to fall back on during this time of crisis as a result of the lockdown several of these msmes have effectively become inoperable and have resorted to massive layoffs just to survive this has resulted in thousands of workers losing their jobs with nowhere to go to for refuge a chunk of these people includes migrant workers who have lost their jobs and are left with little to no avenue to feed themselves not receiving significant support from the government these people have been initiating treks back to their villages what is witnessed is a massive influx of migrant workers flooding the highways walking weeks to find shelter and food truck drivers responsible for delivering goods have also resigned stating that they have no means to eat because of the closure of every food joint on the highways both these realities present a stark contrast and expose a deep crack in our societal framework one i reckon wont heal anytime soon\n",
      "the covid 19 pandemic has restructured our social fabric in a way that is unlikely to change anytime soon the areas that weve discussed are likely to become the flagbearers of the digital revolution of the decade an upward mobilization with regards to massive scale movement of industries online seems pertinent today being led by these domains in the it industry an unfortunate consequence of it is that a majority of the msmes may soon cease to exist having been replaced by some of the other alternatives that weve discussed it seems to be a neverending circle where the ones who are making a profit out of this situation will continue to do so while the others will be washed out from our collective memory\n",

      "although the nature of gaming does not require physical stamina and therefore is not limited by factors such as age gender or fitness it is most popular with adolescents in 2018 the world health organization who classified gaming disorder in their international classification of diseases icd11 the icd11 is a list of diseases and medical conditions that aids health professionals in making diagnoses and treatment plans for patients having various disorders it should be noted that the inclusion of gaming disorder in the icd11 by who has generated vigorous and sometimes contentious debate and discussion within the medical and mental health community although recognized as an area of clinical interest the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm5 published by the american psychiatric association suggests that more clinical research is required before gaming disorder is formally considered as a psychiatric disorder similarly the who notes the inclusion of gaming disorder in icd11 to encourage more research into excessive gaming behavior including its prevention and treatment\n",

      "2018 who draft 11th revision of the icd11 denotes the disorder as a pattern of digitalgaming or videogaming behavior characterized by impaired control over gaming activity increasing priority given to gaming over other activities to the extent that gaming takes precedence over other interests and daily activities and the continuation or escalation of gaming despite the occurrence of negative consequences\n",
      "online gaming disorder has the same similarities with internet gaming disorder igd which is a condition that the american psychiatric association apa noted in dsm5 as an area in need of additional study the apa does not currently recognize igd as an official condition for gaming disorder to be diagnosed the who criteria require that the behavioral pattern of the gamer must be of sufficient severity that major and noticeable impairment and deterioration in personal family social educational occupational or other important areas of functioning is present for a minimum of 12 months\n",
      "according to the who definition a person with online gaming disorder will demonstrate the following characteristics for at least 12 months problems controlling control their gaming habits seeing gaming as more important over other necessities and daily activities or work continuing to engage in gaming even after its negative health and social problems has been identified or are evident further research shows that gaming disorders can also be linked to anxiety depression obesity sleeping disorders and stress people who remain physically inactive for long periods because of gaming may also be at higher risk of obesity sleep disorders and other healthrelated issues according to who 1\n",

      "video game playing is associated with eye problems extensive and fixed staring at a video game screen causes eyestrain because the cornea pupil and iris are not biologically equipped for chronic heavy viewing of digital images from electronic devices the visual system strain from frequent video game use over extended periods may result in headaches dizziness and in some cases nausea and vomiting interestingly there is some research that shows that gamers have an enhancement of spatial distribution of attention compared with nongamers this somewhat predictable practice effect occurs with both peripheral and central visual attention for sufferers of amblyopia dimness or blurring of the eyesight due to a fault in transmission from the eye to the brain video games may be helpful\n",
      "persistent gamers may also suffer from musculoskeletal problems a survey of children indicated increased physical complaints associated with video game playing such complaints range from pain in the hands and wrists to back and neck furthermore a case report involving a nineyearold teenager referenced playstation thumb playstation thumb is characterized by numbness and a blister is caused by friction between the thumb and the controller from rapid and persistent gameplay using dermoscopy dermatologists discovered hemorrhages and onycholysis the loosening or separation of a fingernail in a patient who presented with hyperkeratosis also tendon injuries tendinosis of the hands and wrists from tendon overuse is another health problem associated with video game playing furthermore another case report in the new england journal of medicine reported a fracture of the base of the fifth metatarsal from people who play wii video games this condition has been termed perhaps sarcastically a wii fracture there are also postural problems associated with the persistent playing of video games although ergonomic measures including chair to monitor position could potentially improve postural problems associated with video game playing\n",
      "playing video games consistently has been associated with obesity this is maybe related to the lack of physical activity in players alternatively it could be that those who are less physically fit because of obesity gravitate towards less physically demanding activities such as gaming in either case several studies have linked television and video games and increased body mass index bmi it has been estimated that children in the united states spend 25 of their waking hours watching either television or playing video games furthermore children who watch the most hours of television or play video games have the highest incidence of obesity if video games are replacing physical activities and young people do not participate in physical recreation or see playing of video games as a form of recreation this may be part of the link between times spent while playing video games and a rise in bmi in teenagers evidence for this potential link gains some support from a german study reporting that boys who spend no more than 15 hours per day engaged in television watching or playing video games were 754 less likely to be overweight than those who spend more than 15 hours engaged in the same activity\n",
      "in a 2011 study an association between video game activity and an increase of mostly junk food intake was reported specifically single video game sessions caused an increase in food intake regardless of appetite it has also been suggested that active video game play using two popular gaming platforms has the opposite effect other researchers found no evidence that more active video games would result in a beneficial outcome although the study did demonstrate an increase in the amount of physical activity within the children receiving the active video games\n",
      "health concerns that video games may cause epileptic seizures started in the early 1980s the first medically documented case of a video gameinduced seizure was reported in 1981 in 1993 a story in the popular press sun newspaper reported that a boy choked to death on his own vomit during a seizure triggered by playing a video game similar but less serious incidents were subsequently reported by news media around the world ultimately motivating video game console manufacturers to include that epilepsy warnings in the instruction manuals for their gaming products in 1994 it was reported that video games only cause seizures in people already predisposed to epilepsy and advised that people with a predisposition to epilepsy can greatly reduce the risk of a seizure by staying 10 feet or more away from the tv set and wearing sunglasses while playing video games this is clearly an area in need of additional research\n",

      "\n",
      "1 accuracy of voice search\n",
      "in the past if you wanted relevant answers from a voice recognition technology wellgood luck with that but today machine learning systems can compete with people in terms of accuracy googles voice recognition google is now able to understand human language with 95 percent accuracy these improvements mean that while you can trust good voice systems to match customers with the right products services or information with increasing degrees of nuance leading businesses already have set customer expectations for delivery thanks to machine learning algorithms that can detect speech and respond with meaningful results\n",
      "2 the interest in voice is only going to grow\n",
      "because voice search systems are at a point where they actually can perform reliably and meet customer expectations just as well if not better than traditional query options customer trust in them is growing\n",

      "4 how voice become part of customerbrand interactions\n",
      "voice search can be used on both desktop and mobile searches we can see that customers want different types of information from voice systems they also can use it at many points in the customer journey for example about half of shoppers use voice to research products even near me searches results are mostly done by customers customers also use voice to\n",

      "how the covid19 crisis is redefining jobs and services\n",
      "\n",
      "the pandemic has shaken the world in the way one had hardly imagined the impact of it on jobs and services is going to be longlasting and it will be the foundation stone of revolution in these sectors with the work from home and social distancing norms is altering the way of work the way we interact what work we will do how the work will be done and whatnot to just give an example in the middle of the first lockdown fmcg major hindustan unilever hul went ahead with its merger it took place online entirely yes it took place online who could have ever imagined the merger can take place online\n",
      "change is inevitable but some changes are temporary and some are permanent the pandemic is bringing changes that are going to be permanent in fact these changes were due for a long time and were coming at a slow pace what the pandemic has done is it has become the catalyst for these changes and raised the ante for change so what exactly the changes will be lets look at them one by one\n",
      "the first change is going to be the extensive use of digital communication from now onwards the zoom jio meet google meet and some derivatives like these are going to be the forever meeting rooms where the important discussions will be held this may be bad news for the employees who are older than 40 years they would not have pictured themselves doing such transformation at this part of life experts believe that the new normal in the offices are going to be hierarchyless the older employees would have to work with the younger ones there would be no geographical boundaries and where the communication and software adaptability among employees is going to be crucial the symbol of power will be less visible and the decentralization of power in the office will be prominent there will be more egalitarianism in companies the corporates will think much more about office space rather than expending too much on physical infrastructure the online infrastructure will always be in their hindsight the impact would be more prudent in small and midsized businesses the physical offices itself might disappear from such businesses but its not going to be easy for companies the security and confidentiality of the authentic information going out of the offices building are going to be the largest concern in the new normal world there would be no surprise if a lot of startups will bloom in the near future providing software for security for the data and information of the companies also travel is going to be reduced so the major component of ctc where the companies fooling the employees must find the other way\n",
      "the second change is going to be struck down on employees already many of the companies and startups are reducing the workforce it is expected that new normal offices would work with an 80 workforce of that of the current workforce automation is on the verge due to safety reasons the companies are going to be more and more leaned towards automation with a minimal touch of human possible this might result in a loss of jobs in some sectors but it will also create new jobs in the automation sector it was evident from before pandemic too but now the velocity for the same would be increased in the new normal techenabled world the job which would be at stake dominantly would be managers managers the it firms have started firing the vice presidents and assistant vice presidents who draw hefty salaries but dont really drive the business in the designationless set up in the near future accelerated by pandemic they automatically become redundant for the first time the employees might be given jobs that would require more than the standard jobs also when the workforce in the company would be less in the company the employees might be given the option of working for extra time or working on the weekends and would be incentivized for the same rather than employing more staff and paying them full salary it is a winwin situation for both employees and companies employees can earn more than what they usually earn and will get to learn new which would be out of their primary domain the companies would be able to keep their costs low through this the assessment of employees might change too rather than going for an annual performance review the employees might be evaluated based on the tasks they perform creativity and innovation are going to be swords for the employees in the new normal world rather than designations in the office  \n",
      "the other change might be in the services sector the services like which involves maximum human touch will be the one which will be affected most adversely the safety concerns and confidence of people over the system are going to be the issue for at least the next few years it also opens the opportunity for something very new the products which could replace the need for visiting such services centers are going to create a boom in the market according to mckinsey the sales for such products are multiplying rapidly\n",
      "there are speculations that the economies will tend to become minimalist economies lets dig deep into this minimalist economies are the economies where people tend to refrain from purchasing luxurious items and focuses on purchasing necessities more and more  well this is the position we are in right now during the pandemic people are expensing only necessary items like groceries and the demand for luxurious items is way below average but it would be hard to stay the same as this the minimalist economy will result in the deterioration of the economy in the short term it is true that in the minimalist economy the demand might be low but it would be wrong to assume the demand will be zero the highquality products will gather the attention of the purchasers it is evident from past experiences that the economy always finds its way to come back from the mode of minimalist economy though this time may take some time it will surely return on track\n",
      "but every trouble comes with an opportunity this is the time for the companies to act now and grab the opportunities the pandemic has brought with him but for that companies are required to follow plans formulate strategies to suit their needs and pay more attention to the innovation the companies must form plans for the five stages from here these stages are 5rs resolve resilience return reimagination and reform\n",
      "resolve in the resolve phase companies need to formulate a nerve center to combat corvid itself the tendency of the company should not be like that they will return only after everything becomes normal in most parts of the country permission is granted to the companies for their operations if they wait for normalcy then bankruptcy might catch them before the normalcy\n",
      "resilience the resilience phase includes maintaining liquidity addressing solvency and grow for sustainability all businesses should know when their cash crunch is coming addressing these cash crunches will be crucial for the companies businesses must take aggressive options to remain solvent for example the businesses might have cash in their hand but might be poor in operational efficiency then it requires the attention of the company organizations solving issues of liquidity and solvency will be in a better position to grow with sustainability\n",
      "return in the third phase of return the companies will have to plan for the time when everything will be back on track given the possibility of subsequent waves of coronavirus the companies need new ways of working to prevent identify report and contain future flareups many industries will face this problem of returning staying prepared for resurgence scenarios should include a multiscenario modeling exercise reverting to noncovid19 care will require extensive planning and market testing\n",
      "reimagine the phase of reimagining will include the learnings from the pandemic a small virus and the whole economy at the toss the businesses will have to introspect them and must look for advancements in technologies such that this kind of pandemic in the future will not disturb their efficiency too much the pandemic has taught us that the decision which took weeks and months in the normal world can be accelerated and can be taken in some days this should become a permanent feature cross organizational collaboration has become much easier this should stay in the long run\n",
      "reform the last phase is the reform in this phase the companies should look at their bottlenecks and try to fix them also the companies will have to reconsider their relationship with their customers the confidence in their brands they must regain it\n",
      "there are three ways to shift work talent and skills to where and when they are needed most thereby building the organizational resilience and agility necessary to navigate uncertain times and rebound with strength when the economy recovers\n",
      "in this dismal situation it is more important than ever most of the staff should be in the critical tasks the tasks could be like the customer complaints redressal we know that the customers are the ones who make the businesses successful thus retaining their confidence is the utmost priority the organizations can convert some of the staff to address the queries and concerns of customers the organizations require to create virtual offices there should not be the geographical boundaries within the organization the employees from all over the world from the organization should come together and take the organization back to precorvid state by breaking out of rigid job constraints the right talent and work can be matched to solve evolving business challenges in realtime\n",
      "this was happening before the pandemic too but accelerating it with pace has now become the need of the hour the perception that automation is a jobkiller is totally wrong and in fact it is the mandatory capability to deal with the crisis organizations can increase automation in call centers this will reduce the response time\n",
      "temporarily moving employees from some industries like airlines restaurants hospitality can be moved to those organizations which have maximum work at this time like healthcare and logistics\n",
      "to conclude the companies should understand lives come first but livelihood matters the pandemic will have some adverse effects on jobs and services but this is not the end the pandemic has brought many opportunities with him and if they are grabbed then the organizations would be in much better position even compared to precorvid situations the companies need to understand the pandemic is not going to be forever the last concluding sentence will be corona will bring changes but there will not be a revolution in jobs and services\n",

      "\n",
      "social media is such a staple of our evolving digital culture that its almost hard to imagine a time without updates likes comments and shares people are more concerned about how their food looks than about how it tastes thus it has become necessary for any brand to have a social media presence the phrase out of sight out of mind has never been so apt than in todays time social media is as much about engagement with other people as it is about sharing content its why we call it social media\n",
      "social media engagement simply is the interaction between the customer and the brand on social media platforms where else are you going to find a huge database of your target demographic who are already in the mind frame to read click on and share your message\n",
      "in practicality it is not about a oneoff communication but more about the construction of a longterm relationship with your target customers hence when we talk about such a relationship it is imperative to consider the positive actions of users as a reaction of any brands engagement tactics\n",
      "a fundamental customer journey can be envisaged in the form of customer funnel the touchpoints available at every step can be shown as \n",

      "how many retweets on twitter how many reactions to the post on facebook how many likes on instagram how many shares on linked in this seems to be the new age resume\n",
      "thus a good question or mystery for any brand is how to measure their social media engagement as with most online actions its often difficult to measure offline benefits more often than not the online campaigns do not drive any conversions on the same dayweek but a user may see those posts and become more familiar with the brand that familiarity later on might result in him choosing that brand over an unknown competitor social media engagement as a result helps businesses in developing their brands personality improves visibility and becomes its voice\n",
      "customers exhibit dynamic behavior based on the type of product it could range from picking and varietyseeking to high involvement processes comprising extensive information search top of the mind recall rules due to this purchasing behavior implies that targeted advertising and marketing is extremely important no one engagement strategy can be applied across brands each brands strategy must differ based on what the brand is trying to sell its target customers and the beliefs of the brand\n",
      "some of the key aspects of marketing strategy that we have influenced as vital cogs in the digital marketing wheel are\n",
      "influencer marketing\n",
      "influencer marketing involves a brand collaborating with an online influencer to market one of its products or services here the audience doesnt care much about your brand but the opinions of the influencers\n",
      "an influencer as being someone who has\n",
      "2017 saw chanel being named as the most influential luxury brand on social media since then it has continued to grow and diversify its portfolio while providing constant engagement to its plethora of followers especially on instagram \n",
      "crosschannel marketing\n",
      "crosschannel marketing or multichannel marketing is the practice of using multiple channels to reach an audience because not everyone uses every single platform its a good idea to have a presence on a few and share some of the same content across the different networks what makes a difference in this marketing strategy is the choice of platforms apart from using basics like facebook instagram and twitter a clever use of spotify youtube or igtv to showcase the brand can make a real difference\n",
      "the luxury vehicle brand land rovers crosschannel marketing includes the google display network homepage masthead and masthead in lightbox ads on youtube and visibility through mobile search and google the brands digital campaign included four different influencers who created visual content for their blogs by taking trips to places like glacier national park and the appalachian mountains and land rovers microsite their crosschannel efforts resulted in 100 million impressions from youtube and a 10 increase in search ad ctr further results found that online leads from its digital channel efforts now account for 15 of the brands total sales\n",
      "informative\n",
      "the content created on social media must add some value addition to the customers the brand must constantly keep informing the customers about their existing products new products achievements of the brands or even casual content there should be wow i didnt know this factor only then will they become regular followers of the brand\n",
      "an example of this would be a cosmetic brand posting makeup tutorials fenty beauty is one such prime example which has built up to 14m followers within just 4 days of its launch eventually garnering close to 10m followers with rihanna being one of their icons\n",
      "involving customers  engaging them\n",
      "customer is king is a known concept it is the foundation of traditional marketing so while we shift to social platforms brands must not forget them understanding their needs addressing them inviting them to respond and take part in the brands online activities while keeping it interesting and entertaining for the customer is the key\n",
      "founder and ceo of glossier emily weiss described the brand as the first sociallydriven beauty brand glossier was certainly the pioneer in the term instagram brands  using the platform not only to build awareness but also to have focused conversation with the customer glossier often crowdsources product development asking its instagram followers what theyd like to see next \n",
      "dynamic\n",
      "the content creation must be dynamic and suitable for the current season festival or event that is happening people must be able to relate to the posts and they must get excited after seeing it\n",
      "starbucks does a marvelous job when it comes to being dynamic their oneoff recipes and continuous hype around seasonal events and related drinks have won them a silver ipa effectiveness award for its social strategy in 2018 the launch of its now iconic unicorn frappuccino spurred on the trend of brands deliberately creating instagrammable food and drink as a result there are now 557232 posts using the hashtag\n",
      "product focussed\n",
      "now of course the real motive behind any marketing activity is to eventually sell the product so it becomes extremely important to not lose the essence of the product while marketing in simple terms the content or strategy must not leave the customer confused about what the brand actually does or what it is trying to sell\n",
      "to support the productcentric statement oreo is the best example oreos social media strategy has never diverged from its original formula completely productfocused and yet always creative the brand continuously finds ways to put its cookies center stage the daily twist campaign to mark its 100th birthday saw the brand turn its oreo cookie into something of cultural relevance for 100 days including elvis presley a baseball and a rainbow flag in support of pride \n",

      "petty entrepreneurs like streetside food stalls form an essential part of an economy that plays a significant role in balancing the development of a nations economy the importance of street food vendors not only helps in increasing the countrys per capita income but also helps to make a living for the unemployed in society with a limited investment most of them are the sole breadwinners for their families so with the covid19 wreaking havoc the uncertainty of the lockdown policies increased the concern of people over hygiene and the lack of investment to upgrade their businesses to provide better hygiene facilities that can take away food from their mouths\n",
      " various states have provided relief packages and support but in a country as populous as ours it has hardly been appropriately implemented delhi for instance recently announced a rupee 500 million stimulus package to nearly 500000 rupees recognizing the severe consequences of the loss of livelihoods the sellers intended remedy is a credit loan that provides all sellers with an initial working capital of rs 10000 but this is not enough instead of loans the government should consider converting them directly into income benefits cash subsidies to secure a livelihood in order to initiate incomegenerating activities on a regular basis sellers need income support to get back to work and if they cant they will never be able to repay the loan amount in an everchanging crisis organizations need to take a step forward and ensure that providers are provided with the resources they need to make a living pandemics have had a vast economic impact on every sector but the most vulnerable sectors such as street vendors suffer the most decreased income can affect most necessities such as payments to family and yourself due to a lack of fixed salaries stalls cannot quit their jobs if possible it might be only a few days unlike regular employees for them the risk of infection is far less frightening than hunger\n",
      "unlike many of the businesses most of these food vendors lack the infrastructure to go online and sell products through platforms like swiggy or zomato\n",
      "regret not going digital before says dilip das a street side food stall owner at sector v kolkata dilip das used to run a small streetside food stall that provided meals to all the employees around the area which is filled with multinational companies it was a booming business till the arrival of covid then with the lockdown arriving almost all the companies opted for work from home policies dilip tried to start deliveries but with a lack of support and fear of infection that business ended before it even started\n",
      "citing similar reasons swapan mondal who runs a south indian food stall at park street said that he did know how to operate a smartphone and since sales were good he did not care about learning either but with the implementation of lockdown which took place within 4 hours people like swapan barely had time to cope with the changes\n",
      "furthermore the covid 19 pandemic made people realize how important trains are in our life with most of the train network suspended the entire supply chain was disrupted hundreds of quintals of food products rotted away awaiting the logistical issues to fix many businesses could not afford to run without proper supplies as well\n",

      "the impact of covid19 was extremely severe for informal workers who ran out of capital and income and to try to feed themselves during this long embargo sellers need to be able to resume sales in order to survive and governments need to take steps to reopen the market and bring sellers back to the business\n",
      "reopening of markets keeping in mind social distancing and hygiene\n",
      "india has different types of traditionally crowded markets even weekly markets fresh food cooked food and essentials and daily roadside markets these markets have to reopen with the need for social distance in mind and the government needs to publish guidelines for that in the future sales areas will also need to be designed with social distance and the need for adequate sanitation running water wash areas toilets in mind authorities need to work with the town bending commission tvc\n",
      "provision of direct support that is devoid of existing registration requirements\n",
      "once the restrictions are lifted and the impact of covid 19 is somewhat manageable sellers who have been at home for months will need direct income benefits to help them to return to work the government initiative is a welcome move but not in terms of the type of bailout and eligibility is enough in addition there are very few registered providers in india so government relief and support must be separated from the very strict registration requirements in delhi alone  of the approximately 300000 street vendors only approximately 13100 have some sort of professional id if all types of cash grants or livelihood support standards relate to job identification by the state  the government must also accept registration with workers organizationsunions on behalf of governmentissued sales badges\n",
      "ensuring social distancing and proper sanitation and hygiene at sites of businesses\n",
      "the government and municipal corporations need to take the initiative and running water and soapsanitizers need to be provided for street vendors at their place of work moreover the streetside food vendors should work with food safety authorities in the country to train themselves in different ways to maintain hygiene whilst working\n",
      "taking steps to spread awareness of different government initiatives and reliefs\n",
      "many small businessmen and food vendors do not even know their rights and the benefits they can claim if they did many still have no idea about how to claim them proper awareness camps need to be set up to help these smalltime food vendors to know how they can get assistance and help from the government and return back to the business\n",

      "the coronavirus also known as covid19 is not only a global public health emergency but also a source of significant regional and increasingly global economic disruption this impacts the energy and climate world in many ways the economic downturn puts pressure on global oil prices leading the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec to consider further cuts to production it hurts the demand for natural gas during a time of extremely low prices it changes the economic energy and climate policymaking environment in china one of the most consequential energy consumers and sources of greenhouse gas emissions and it has temporarily disrupted supply chains throughout the energy industry including renewable energy at a time when supply chain connections with china were being revaluated due to ongoing tariff and trade disputes how consequential or transformative any of these changes are for the energy sector or for climate efforts will depend upon the ultimate trajectory of the virus outbreak itself\n",
      " sarah ladislaw senior vice president and director energy security and climate change program\n",
      "the energy sector has already felt the impacts of the coronavirus the outbreak has contributed to a dampened demand for oil resulting in plummeting oil prices and production declines as we move forward then the energy sector expects to face two headwinds managing the issues of the health emergency all sectors face and simultaneously coping with a low oilprice scenario lower demand and the need to shore up revenue and manage debt obligations\n",
      "impact of covid19 on indian energy markets\n",
      "in india distribution utilities have a lower tariff for domestic and agricultural consumers sometimes even below the average cost of supply as compared to that for commercial and industrial consumers table 1 provides the electricity tariff rates in delhi for selected consumer categories to highlight these differences thus for several distribution companies the lower tariffpaying consumers are crosssubsidized by commercial and industrial consumers\n",
      "the covid19 lockdown has led to shut down of all but essential commercial activities across the country approximately 13 billion citizens are obliged to remain within the confines of their homes and in many cases only allowed to work from home consequently the electricity demand from industrial and commercial customers has reduced significantly while the residential demand is expected to have increased according to the power system operation corporation of india posoco the energy met on march 16th 2020  which can be considered as a businessasusual scenario  was 3494 mu as compared to 3113 mu on march 23rd 2020 a day of voluntary curfew it further reduced to a range between 26002800 mu between march 25th to march 31st 2020 this trend is illustrated in the below figure 1\n",
      "thus firstly a key risk from the covid19 pandemic for the already struggling distribution companies in india arises from the loss of revenues due to the reduction of demand from the commercial and industrial customers as well as the inability to cover the crosssubsidies provided to the lowertariff paying consumer secondly the utilities would also have to account for the expense to comply with any must buy commitments that they have with generators with longterm power purchase agreements the true and full extent of this risk would only be known once a quantitative analysis is conducted when this crisis situation is contained thirdly at an operational level distribution companies would have to account for deviation in demand and supply patterns at a temporal and locational level finally during this period critical infrastructure such as electricity networks would have to be run with minimum employees\n",
      "as seen in figure 1 the trade on the wholesale power market comprises just 43 percent of the total electricity transactions however the transactions through the power exchanges have grown over the last decade the indian energy exchange iex has seen a growth from 2616 mu in fy 2009 to 52241 in fy 2019\n",
      "until now the trade in the wholesale market is in four market segments\n",

      "recently the central electricity regulatory commission cerc finalized the regulations for implementing realtime markets this halfhourly market will enable the intraday trade of electricity allowing adjustment of generation and consumption profile during the day before the covid19 pandemic it was announced by cerc that the realtime market would be operational from april 1st 2020 however the starting date has now been delayed by two months to june 1st 2020 according to media reports due to the covid19 pandemic some required trials could not be completed this delay in the realtime market implementation is likely to have a serious adverse impact on the indian power market\n",
      "another impact of the covid19 pandemic on the power markets is in terms of the market dynamic it can be observed that there is a dip in the clearing volume and the marketclearing price which coincides with the gradually increasing shutdown measures taken by the government as a response to covid19 see figure 2 thus the reduction in demand due to the lockdown is reflected in the volumes traded on the electricity market and the clearing price\n",
      "another point of reference is the price and clearing volume in 2019 on march 22nd 2020 the day of voluntary lockdown the clearing volume was 9705 gwh and the clearing price was 219548  mwh in comparison on the same day in 2019 the clearing volume was 10798 gwh and the clearing price was 281618  mwh from the start of the lockdown from march 25nd to april 1st 2020 the average clearing volume was 10427 gwh compared to 13024 gwh in 2019 during the same period similarly the average market clearing price was 215593  mwh in 2020 as compared to 3371025  mwh in 2019 for the same period\n",
      "views of the shareholders in india\n",
      "the lockdown has resulted in a shutdown of the industrial and commercial establishments and the stoppage of passenger railway services this has adversely impacted the all india electricity demand given that these segments constitute about 40 of the all india electricity demand a statement issued by the rating firm said\n",
      "further these segments account for an even greater percentage of the discoms sales revenues given that they are the subsidizing segments this apart with the focus of state governments being on healthcare and relief measures the likelihood of subsidy support to the discoms getting deferred cannot be ruled out it added\n",
      "icra ratings group head and senior vice president  corporate ratings sabyasachi majumdar said the lockdown imposed by the government is likely to adversely impact the all india electricity demand with demand expected to decline by about 2025 on a yearonyear basis during the period of lockdown this would in turn adversely impact the revenues and cash collections for distribution utilities in the near term especially given the consumption decline from the high tariff paying industrial and commercial consumers and likely delays in cash collections from other consumer segments the revenue deficit for the discoms is estimated to be about rs 130 billion per month on an all india basis this would in turn adversely impact the liquidity profile of the discoms increase their subsidy requirement and lead to delays in payments to the power generation and transmission companiesthe power ministry on friday issued directors to the central electricity regulatory commission to provide a moratorium of three months to discoms on payments to power generation and transmission companies\n",
      "the power ministry on friday issued directors to the central electricity regulatory commission to provide a moratorium of three months to discoms on payments to power generation and transmission companies and requested state governments to issue similar directions to state electricity regulators\n",
      "the power generation companies are already suffering delays in payments by discoms across the majority of states with payment due of more than rs 85000 crore as of november 2019 at all india level as per the data on praapti portal\n",
      "with covid19 lockdown accentuating the delays in payments the availability of adequate liquidity buffer in the form of debt service reserve and undrawn working capital limits remains important from a credit perspective\n",
      "however it said that relief measures such as a moratorium on debt servicing over a 3month period as notified by reserve bank of india and expected moderation in the interest rate cycle would be a source of comfort in the near term the timely approval of the moratorium by the boards of the banks and financial institutions remains crucial\n",
      "the revenues for power generation companies having longterm power purchase agreements ppas with the state distribution utilities discoms will be protected by the provision for capacity charges linked to plant availability in case of thermal and large hydropower projects and mustrun status in case of nuclear and renewable power projectsaverage monthly thermal plf would further dip to 5052 against 63 in the corresponding period of the previous year due to a considerable drop in demand and consequently power generation companies especially those without any longterm ppas would be adversely impacted given the weakening of the power tariffs in the shortterm  power exchange market said icra ratings sector head  vice president girishkumarkadamthe underconstruction renewable power projects as well as epc and manufacturing companies in the solar segment are likely to face execution delays because of disruption in the supply chain in india and labor availability following the lockdown given the import dependency on china for sourcing pv modules the execution timelines for the ongoing solar projects are likely to be affected by delays in the delivery of pv modules following the outbreak of covid 19 in china\n",
      "this delay in turn would increase the preoperative expenses and the overall project cost which in turn would have an impact on the expected returns\n",
      "in this context the mnre has notified that time extension can be provided for all renewable energy projects which are impacted by the supply chain disruption due to the covid outbreak under the force majeure clause\n",
      "given the execution headwinds amid covid 19 affecting q1 of fy202021 and assuming the normalcy thereafter the capacity addition in the wind and solar segments together is likely to degrow by about 25 thus estimated at about 8 gw against earlier estimates of 11 gw in fy202021 said kadam\n",

      "\n",
      "as a race we are not ready for any kind of crisis we have fire extinguishers in buildings but barely any knowledge of how to use it we convince ourselves that we are prepared but in the face of adversity we stand dumbfounded and give the simplest excuse that of being in unprecedented times the same thing has happened with the coronavirus crisis if we look back we can see that this crisis was not avoidable there was a lot we could have done but because we underestimated it so much the situation has now blown out of proportion and cost us thousands of lives millions of jobs and a massive hit to the world economy we may be in a unique condition but there is still a lot that we can apply from past experiences and previous calamities \n",
      "first lets look at this in a reflective mode what are the things we could have done to avoid this crisis in the first place controlling the origin of a virus is difficult but preventing it from spreading is not one of the biggest contributors to this unforgiving crisis is the lack of communication or even worse the propagation of fake news take india for example clear communication about the virus was only initiated after a few cases had been identified we were aware of the hazards of this virus since before and should have acted sooner the spread of accurate and timely information is a must if we had spread awareness earlier we could have controlled the number of cases better like new zealand and ireland have done secondly in a situation of crisis the first thing to spread is fake news it is imperative that the government social media agencies and people themselves act more responsibly since there is no accurate and transparent information a lot of uncertainty exists in the society this impacts the confidence of consumers and investors in the market which in turn leads to an economic slowdown past experiences with financial breakdowns and recessions have shown us that retain market trust can only occur with transparency and accuracy of information organisations should have acted earlier and communicated more effectively with their employees \n",
      "moreover we must also understand that specific sectors take the hardest hit during lockdowns as we have witnessed in earlier lockdowns curfews national emergencies and pandemics the first segment of society to take a hit is the daily wagers and labourers not only do the prices of goods increase but their income also takes a decline in such a crisis in such situations they cant even afford basic amenities india witnessed a mass exodus recently with thousands of people trying to return to their villages on foot this only leads to more chaos and a decline in containment of the disease the government should have accounted for such factors before announcing a lockdown with a four hour notice they could have made better arrangements for food and water in the metro cities itself or giving them safer means to travel home this is something that they can still include in their relief programs\n",
      "government intervention is a must right now this can be done in two ways first is to create more employment opportunities governments used this strategy in the sars and ebola virus emergency health water sanitation and hygiene are the most services in the times of health emergencies intense investment for these services and infrastructure can provide immediate jobs secondly if governments use fiscal and monetary policy to fuel demand and maintain current living standards it can decrease the propensity of a huge fall in economic growth a fiscal stimulus by the government can make all the difference having better avenues for cash transfers easier loans and more exchange will automatically help a fall in the growth rate is unavoidable as lots of sectors have no choice but to pause all work however industries that can provide high returns even now must be encouraged for example it sector health food and agriculture etc\n",
      "moreover governments and businesses should use the most important tool in their hand the internet even in the times of physical social distancing we are still connected to people across the world and are socialising at our normal rates governments should use these mediums to maintain public spirit communicate policy strategies and inform people businesses should use these means to continue working and maintain employee morale to have balanced crisis management and to prevent panic in the masses social dialogue and engagement at every level is imperative use these mediums to educate people about the importance of social distancing hygiene and steps to be followed\n",
      "all diseases are different and the scientific approach to tackle them varies however with most epidemics and pandemics some common steps can be followed our past experience with fast spreading diseases has shown that the easiest and most effective way to curb it is social distancing countries have taken impressive steps to ensure social distancing and must keep this up for even a few weeks after curbing the disease maintaining sanitary habits and hygiene can protect us from infections and increase our immunity while governments and medical agencies look for ways to tackle the virus at a macro level we must continue to follow all measures on an individual level too\n",
      "we must also pay a lot of attention to mental and physical wellbeing now in the past when economies took a hit due to the 2008 recession or calamities the first thing to break was peoples selfesteem suicide rates amount of domestic abuse and cases of depression increased manifold we have to take effort and ensure that we try and live as much of a balanced life as possible we should stay connected to our friends and not be ashamed of reaching out to others for help social distancing is not easy and can take a toll on many lots of special helplines have been set up for the same and people must use them if needed governments have also given code words for victims of domestic abuse to report crimes in countries like france and spain we must remember to stay mentally healthy and calm during a crisis as that is the most important thing\n",
      "i dont believe that every crisis is the same of course there are a lot of unique things about the coronavirus pandemic that we had not expected to ever see even though these are different times there are still lots of things we can apply from our past experiences we cannot find a cure for the virus but we can find ways to maintain the economy our mental peace and prevent the spread of the virus the past has a lot to offer if we ponder we must learn to understand the mistakes of the past and better them in the future our past experiences with the different crises have taught us that fiscal stimuli work maintaining employee morale is important and that social engagement is imperative if we use these tools efficiently we can ensure that people only have to fight the virus and not worry about the multitude of repercussions that come with it\n",

      "covid19 an unprecedented pandemic for us but a canbe possibility for great leaders such as bill gates came into action since the rising of the year 2020 the corollary of this pandemic is so prodigious that the analysis by the un department of economic and social affairs desa stated that the covid19 pandemic is disrupting global supply chains and international trade which in turn could shrink the global economy by up to 1 percent in 2020 a reversal from the previous forecast of 25 percent growth more than 66 million americans filed unemployment claims and the economic downturn is expected to be the worst recession since the great depression as stated by the imf india is facing its biggest crisis in decades with a threeweek lockdown initially but extending further in a nation of 13 billion people likely to result in an economic recession millions of job losses and possible starvation among the poor it can be said that economic contagion is now spreading as fast as the disease itself on the contrary nature has pressed the reset button the environment is having a noticeable benefit from this scenario water is getting clearer the air is turning breathable and various such news and pictures can be easily heard and seen on newspapers telly and social media platforms on day to day basis but this is the storyline of the present what about the future are the predictions made by financial institutions and thought leaders going to be true or something unexpected is going to happen that will make us think of our human capabilities again\n",
      "after this storm of covid19 it would not be a surprise to see how digitally every business will grow to provide better digital infrastructure and customer experience along with advancement in technology which we are lacking in this present scenario the touch screens that we are using already will find its vast applications and would be seen in most of the places including hotels hostels and shopping malls all those processes which are interdependent will take an agile turn resulting in better productivity of goods having a systematic backup giving a better experience to the consumer even in hard situations the major focus would be making contactless systems hence artificial intelligence and machine learning will become the most rapid and indemand fields not only this but the medical infrastructure and services will also take a boost in the race of developing the systems to handle any situation afterward the human to machine interaction will increase facilitating fast production delivery and surveillance inculcating many more in each and every area the covid will leave its mark may it be retail sector or may it be the banking sector making them modify or fully change their architectures\n",
      "even the existing systems would be gifted with some modifications ensuring them to work in a hard environment even with or without human intervention the companies will rethink their policies shaping themselves accordingly to manage the resources ensuring safety agility and work to be a top priority the work from home idea will also provide a base for bigger companies ensuring to develop a better infrastructure for their resources and probably giving birth to a new concept of work culture various existing industries related to either delivery or travel may adopt the new idea of collaboration with other industries which will result in more options for consumers on their old routine apps\n",
      "new businesses will root out from the existing ventures resulting in head to head competition in the business world but turning into a brownie point for consumer experience and bandwidth of choices startup culture will go hand in hand and expected to take a stupendous growth in the race of providing us a legitimate opportunity to use and feel the real digital world the various innovations will now take a pace in each field and maybe we will hear some new jargons related to tech in upcoming years since the global economy has fumbled countries will now try to take a different turn to vamoose out of this phase they will try to make new connections by nurturing a give and take relationship and several business relationships would take an unexpected move making the position of several countries sliding up and down on indexes even rival countries may join their hands in this hard time rather than being dismissed totally under predator countries it would be surprising to see how these scenarios will be handled by the emperor of minds and how their opponents are going to take it as an agenda for the next elections\n",
      "unfortunately the nature that is at its best will start to face the ill effects after the chart of development and economy will take a pace for exponential growth it is unfortunate that the inverse relationship between economic growth and environmental destruction exists since carbon emission increases with economic development as shown by the graph below whenever recession took place the carbon emission decreases along with other harmful gases turning out as a gift for nature but doom for the financial markets\n",
      "but there is a possibility that several startups now emerge with the idea of environment conservation collaborating with ngos innovating and using the best of their capability to reduce the ill effect from the present origin point\n",
      "in the culmination we can say this pandemic is like blessing in disguise  producing a massive impact not only on macro but also on microeconomy the novel virus not only brought some unexpected results but also uncovered some of our loopholes and unlatched new opportunities for growth forcing us to define ourselves in several new spheres quite a while ago we all were chitchatting about the digital era how this is benefiting us covid19 revealed making us realize this was just the beginning of digital era and a lot is needed to happen in future it is obvious that not only the indian economy but the global economy is facing and going to face the aftereffects however similar to a virus the economy will also rise from deep grounds to a green candlestick with individual collaboration\n",
      "the businesses will soon rise again people will get back to their jobs vendors will start getting profits and everything will fall into its places but now a megalithic competitive environment will rise which will grow till decades until nature again shows its color and we as a human abide with its outcomes learning some new lessons and keeping this cycle of fall and growth running\n",

      "inquisitive about the conclusion lets attempt to vindicate as the outline story unfolds itself\n",
      "ever since the concept of gaming floated back in the 1970s a new dimension was put before human beings intangible in nature and paradoxically engulfed us since then it laid an impact on multiple generations in different ways the last decade witnessed a boom in this industry  with the advancement of technologies in virtual and augmented reality the gaming world has become an integral part of our day to day experiences with the intent of being regarded as a leisure activity it has now percolated over various strata and has managed to gather the attention of teenagers and adolescents on a comprehensive scale\n",
      "as we explored the fabric of our engineering batch mates we came across this peculiar guy holding excellent academics with accolades of his names seemed to be a nerd at a glance and street smart by nature concomitance happened to be the reason for experiencing the lifestyle of other personalities that included sam as well\n",
      "sam was not only fascinated by the games but used to spend tirelessly hours and hours in front of the white screen engrossed completely leaving the track of time as our academics advanced the intensity of involvement in gaming grew deeper and steadily it turned into addiction in no time we realized the gravity as we were exposed to his change of behavior and shift of priorities due to his unprecedented absence during our lectures and practical he was modestly reluctant to share about his whereabouts with his peers the situation turned grim when he wasnt able to cope up with the subjects and was socially disturbed while interacting he was compelled towards the fantasy world and was trapped in the vicious cycle of a neverending backlog of games as time progressed his performance turned from bad to worse he was struggling it was clear as ice that he had something hidden behind that visage\n",
      "as sophomores we were also involved in gaming but soon realized that it does more harm than good a close cluster of friends decided to lend a helping hand to sam and as they learned about him the ground beneath their feet slipped away and froze their brain he had completely lost the circadian rhythm of his sleep ran into financial losses aggression draped him his relations were tarnished due to the habitual routine and signs of depression were visible on the upfront\n",
      "poker was the tartar that he had caught the game of cards as most of us would perceive it rather proved to be the fulcrum of sams near future in the quest of pleasure through online games he entered the tunnel of gambling at a very tender age ignoring the risks involved in terms of financial verticals he was suffering from internet gaming disorder igd  his condition deteriorated as days passed by apparently from a healthy individual to a drained skinny one it took a toll on his physical health mental disturbance sucked him and he grew insensitive towards his academics the psychological negative consequences were due to the combination of online gaming and gambling platforms during that phase the peer group gaming group gained more influence than parental control \n",
      "days arrived when he ran short of money and went ahead to ask his friends in college for the funds since a large amount of money is involved in gambling a situation exacerbated when sam had his ethical values on the line and breached his boundaries to satisfy his hunger of gaming and leaped towards illegal means to fund his gambling\n",
      "the practical project was a crucial part of our engineering curriculum under which a team of four members was to be established and is expected to remain intact for a year sam was by no means in anyones good books no one in the batch was ready to risk with sam even though he possessed a brilliant acumen he was abandoned we were three friends already and were scouting for the fourth with mutual consensus we decided to go ahead with sam initially we worked together and collaboration seemed to be perfect unfortunately he wasnt able to clear his backlog exams and had to drop out at present he plays poker on a professional level keeping aside his engineering career and battling with his conscience that we may not be aware of  \n",
      "earlier generations used to spend their time or rather invest their time into activities building up their passion in some cases they pushed their cognition to such an extreme and contributed to a level that humanity as a whole is indepth to date can we imagine our present without the existence of sir edison sir newton sir tesla sir einstein and many more that were engrossed in their domain and served the necessary impetus for our generation no one knows that sam could have been our generation scientist hadnt he chose that path  \n",
      "not everyone is sam but perhaps we could miss our einstein or tesla maybe our newton is waiting for the new upgraded version of the game instead of sitting under the tree our mendeleev might be involved in arcade games \n",
      "feels so numb  \n",
      "millions of teenagers are involved in online gaming platforms and the community is growing at a rapid rate every year presently the prevalence of igd among the adolescent group was between 13 to 199 and males reported more prevalence than females in the fiscal year 2019 there were 300 million online gamers in india this number was estimated to go up to 440 million gamers by the fiscal year 2022 overall india ranked the highest in terms of the growth in online game downloads on app stores with a growth rate of 165 percent between 2016 to 2018 75 of young people use a mobile phone to play different games 21 use pclaptop games like pubg that promote virtual violence calls for the stern attention of the responsible demographics as per a study online games are directly affecting the neurons leading to chemical imbalance thus causing severe depression and anxiety attacks  \n",
      "as per the world health organization depression is interrelated to physical and mental health and the word depression that didnt exist decades back has become prevalent among the youth leading to more stress and dysfunction and worsening the affected persons life situation\n",

      "as the global coronavirus or covid19 pandemic continues to take hold every economy is feeling its effect with a high degree of uncertainty taking a toll in all the manufacturing sectors supply chain management is an important area with many opportunities for our community to contribute in various forms  according to the data produced by supply managements report on business show that pmi purchasing managers index has declined 1 in the month of february mainly there has been a huge contraction in the petroleum transportation and textile industries although there has been a fall in the inventory but is expected to grow due to supply chain disruptions leading to inefficiencies in material conversion and continued advanced stocking to protect production schedules a analysis by trading platform forex claimed that heavily 75 of all companies had already reported supply chain disruptions with more than 80 believing that at some point they would experience impacts as a result of covid19 disruptions the effective shutdown of industrial activity ie china ground zero for the virus presented particularly difficult problems for manufacturing firms worldwide imported goods invested by investors set a significant setback\n",
      "several experiments were carried out by different governments across the globe to restrict the spread of this pandemic boris johnson introduced the herd immunity plan in the united kingdom which was a failure followed by a mitigate model which india also tried initially to stop the spread of the covid19 virus the last and the ultimate model that most of the countries are applying is the hammer and the dance model ie the lockdown model which is estimated to bring down the caseload by 2530 the lockdown model basically means buying time to prepare the vaccine to kill the virus\n",
      "however the lockdown has certain critical economic consequences which add to the burden of global distress this can be explained using the standard macroeconomic keynesian model the lockdown and the spread of the disease have a direct negative shock on aggregate consumption levels and exports this leads to a contraction in aggregate demand which leads to a fall in the market rate of interest and aggregate equilibrium output the secondary effect on the commodity market is via investment demand function which can either increase owing to a fall in the market rate of interest or fall owing to the contraction in aggregate demand clearly the contraction of the aggregate demandside generates an economic slowdown on the other hand restriction of workers gathering in the workplace owing to lockdown hurts the production in those sectors which need the presence of physical workers note that software or financial serviceproducing sectors are exempted from such negative supply shock at least in the shortrun to mediumrun since those works could be easily carried out based on work from home anthem however reverse migration of workers is an indication of a sharp cut down in production activities this aggregate supply shock leads to the situation of stagflation in recent announcements by the reserve bank of india rbi to ease liquidity in the system may prove to be counterproductive provided the aggregate supply shock since the escalation of demand specifically for nontraded products without an adequate increase in production supply would only result in inflation in other words supplyside management must go hand in hand with demandside policies even if policies are undertaken at the national level by the government however conditions may not improve much due to shocks in the external sector through trade in commodities most imports are banned which will increase the economic cost of production of import substitutes within the domestic territory based on the theory of comparative advantage in a ricardian sense at the same time exports are hurt due to lower demand from the developed economies this shows that unemployment and inflation are inevitable in the near future\n",
      "corona virus has mainly affected raw material exportdriven countries with the covid19 virus in the backdrop there will be a decline in new orders production and employment with ease in supplier deliveries as demand will be less with a mild decline in the inventories there has been a huge revenue impact long stretches of empty supermarket shelves and shortage of essential commodities are only the visible impacts to consumers of the global chain disruption caused by the covid19 pandemic the uncertainties ahead swing between extremes as the shortages worsen before they get resolved prices of many commodities could go up for consumers even if laws exist against price gouging at the same time we should keep in mind that constrained supplies could cause a decline in demand which in turn may end up weakening prices risk management process is not robust enough to cope with the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic the seemingly relentless forces of globalization and technology with coronavirus in the backdrop will present us with new supply chain challenges and opportunities for further progress in the near future there is a glimmer of good news as countries globally haven taken preventive measures but the recovery may be fragile\n",
      "the crisis due to the global pandemic is likely to be more serious for developing economies compared to the global financial crisis of 2008 this is due to the fact that the global financial crisis leads to lower demand for exports from the developing economies by the developed nations which further lead to contraction of exportbased industries and other sectors in the developing nations due to intersectoral backward and forward linkage effect however the burden of retrenchments in the formal sector was absorbed in the informal sector in the present situation the problem of vanishing informal sector is evident since informal sector workers are more vulnerable to the spread of the disease due to the absence of nonregulatory authority and out of direct government control moreover lockdown lead to massive close down of this informal units thus the informal sector in this present set up is vanishing due to which the shock absorption capacity of developing economy like india is becoming weaker the global economy is drowning towards deep cycles of economic depression and the aftershocks seem to be longlasting the only way of this global shock seems to be international policy coordination in line with the needs of the domestic economies\n",

      "covid 19 has bought the world to its knees with businesses being shut travel being banned schools and colleges being closed we have observed an impeccable amount of sorrow and despise along with a great amount of mental torture and destruction though situations are improving now and the lockdowns are being lifted it is a fact that it cannot be shunned that this virus will have a long term impact on people and the effects will not only be felt economically and physically but also mentally\n",
      "weve been reading articles regarding the impact of covid 19 on the economy education mental health and every other possible aspect but one topic which has not been talked about much is the impact of covid 19 on office space and coworking industries well it is quite obvious that offices will start functioning now but the covid period hasnt ended this means that social distancing will also have to be followed in offices where it will be a problem to do so because of the lack of adequate infrastructure and space the same will be the condition in coworking industries wherein employees of different companies come and work together under the same roof\n",
      "however these problems are quite obvious though people havent thought about them much but the fact which people fail to notice and understand is that the meaning of space is not only limited to infrastructural space which is measured in square foot or square meters but it also extends to metal space or for that fact space in the minds of people for others and their thoughts as well as opinions\n",
      "coronavirus has left a big scratch in our country just the way a car needs repair after an accident our country will also need repair after the control of this virus but unlike a car our country will require a large amount of time to get restored and to stand straight without any support\n",
      "needless to say the economic stability of our country will definitely be hit because of this reason but the problem is since the earnings of the employers will reduce it will subsequently lead to a drop in the salary of the employees while some employees might be preferred by their bosses and may receive a raise regularly others might be subjected to unfair treatment and made to do the same amount of work for a lower salary\n",
      "people tend to overlook the thin line which exists between cooperation and competition the problem doesnt arise when such a situation happens wherein an employee is getting paid more than the other but instead it arises when people start to compare their earnings as well as benefits to that of others and in todays world where people keep money at the top of their priority list comparisons will play a very important role in the performance of employees and their company\n",
      "since there will exist inequalities and partialities in companies there will also exist a sense of hatred and competition among the employees of the same company who will compete to get a better position or a raise in their salary this may seem beneficial to some as it might compel the employees to work harder and better but however will bring huge losses in the long run the fact is employees might end up doing unethical acts which will help them to make a better impression in their bosss eyes\n",
      "moreover since there will be comparisons among the employees it might happen that the employee of the month ends up being hated by all other employees in the company another situation that might arise is that of bluffing and pretending wherein employees tend to show that they work very hard but they dont this might be practiced by showing the boss that they are working when he is on around and then chilling the rest of the time when the boss goes home or sits in his office in fact employees might also lose interest in working if they sense repeated partialities and inequalities which they might show by quitting the jobs or not performing to their best\n",
      "such situations will definitely arise in companies and offices wherein employees will compete for attention and resources which will have a great impact on the company and its functioning and all this will happen because of only one thing lack of office mental space ie space in the minds of people working together in a particular office for cooperation and teamwork along with ignorance of the fact that things will get better and eventually the same after some time\n",
      "another kind of industry and companies that will be affected due to the longlasting impact of covid 19 is the coworking industry and offices this is because there will be a shortage of resources and the income of people but the maintenance cost to be born for the infrastructure as well the rent will remain the same because of this employees will be told by the company owners to exploit the resources present in the offices and use them to the fullest to compensate for the losses being born and to make better use of the money being used however the number of resources will be the same and so there will be a case of competition between employees of different companies to use resources and take benefits of the same\n",
      "if the above two situations happen to occur at the same time which they most likely will we will observe a scene of intracompany as well as intercompany competition also our personal relations with other employees in the company might also be affected due to this comparison and competition which itself will be a result of limited mental space\n",
      "covid 19 will have severe impacts on the office mental space of companies and people  peoples thoughts how they treat others along with accepting defeat and rejection will be an important aspect of everyones lives moreover we might also observe a shoot in the intensity and frequency of office people going to psychologists because of repeated rejection and unfair treatment however we need to cope with this thing and realize that it is indeed very important for us to start preparing to expand our mental space and that this competition and comparison will not stay for long and should not affect our personal relations and life at any cost\n",

      "while coronavirus has affected the life of every individual it has also affected various industries for better or for worse while certain industries like pharma mobile and webstreaming industries fitness and teleconference apps have boomed during this pandemic industries like tourism fastfood industry retail and leisure sectors have suffered the worst hit due to coronavirus impact\n",
      "during this lockdown to prevent the spreading of coronavirus impact almost all of the companies have adopted a workfromhome culture and have used various teleconference apps to hold meetings teleconference apps are also being used by college institutions and universities so that the studies dont get disrupted also confined to their homes people have started engaging more in fitness apps and web streaming services like netflix youtube and amazon prime are at their zenith\n",
      "while these industries are thriving in this pandemic the most affected industry during this time is the hospitality industry\n",
      "hospitality industry embodies various sectors like transportation traveling airlines hotels and lodges etc hotels and traveling are also a major part of the tourism industry the tourism and hospitality industries may appear somewhat similar but they have their subtle distinctions tourism mainly involves traveling and services to those who are away from home the hospitality industry involves businesses and services that are concerned with leisure and enjoyment and mainly run on customer experience and satisfaction their customers may also be local inhabitants along with tourists\n",
      "the hospitality industry can be majorly divided into accommodations travelling and food and drinks \n",
      "accommodations include hotels resorts hostels motels etc the best of the hotels and resorts that were basking at their peeks now have no option but to lay off their employees many hotels are down to zero occupancies and have led to an immense loss for the hotel establishments the same is the case for resorts hostels motels etc that provide accommodations since there are no occupants there is no money inflow which is leading to the layoffs of employees as the owners are not able to provide paychecks anymore\n",
      "businesses in the accommodation sector that have just started are finding it difficult to cope up with this situation various governments have extended small business bridge loans to cope up with this situation the accommodations sector has no other way to cope with this situation but to wait for the situation to improve so that they can improve their business\n",
      "traveling restrictions are imposed by various governments to avoid the spreading of coronavirus travel agencies car rentals tour operators flights and airlines have been hit quite severely by covid19 due to the fear of spreading coronavirus people have limited their public outings or have stopped stepping out altogether unless to shop for daily essentials coronavirus impact on travel that ban lays out restrictions on who can travel from where to where many international and domestic flights have been suspended to tackle the coronavirus crisis havoc is created across the aviation industry\n",
      "the months from march to may are said to be the busiest times of the year for the tours and travel industry but people are reluctant to travel in the fear of catching coronavirus or getting stuck abroad if the governments announce restrictions thereby overstaying their visas that can imply their future travels abroad airlines and tourism agencies have stopped marketing and advertising as it would be irresponsible and does not make sense during this crisis\n",
      "to cope up with this situation airlines like virgin atlantic and american airlines have started deploying passenger flights to carry cargo while various airlines have laid off commercial travel has dropped tremendously also there is a recent drop in jet fuel prices it is being estimated that many airlines are going to go bankrupt if this situation persists\n",
      "apart from airlines the cruise industry and travel agencies also take a toll this year they are facing cancellations of bookings and some new travel agencies are at a risk of closing down rendering all their employees either losing their jobs or going on unpaid leaves in this time of crisis\n",

      "the hospitality sector in india has witnessed unprecedented deceleration this year in the wake of the covid19 pandemic the indian hotel sector has been hit hard tussling with significantly low demand with very few future bookings since the outbreak of covid19 companies have been canceling interviews at the top hotel management colleges in india the overall hiring sentiment in the country is witnessing a negative impact in the short term with 6065 percent of interviews getting postponed especially in the hospitality services sector following the slowdown across industries triggered by the coronavirus pandemic even the students who were aspiring for a career in the hospitality industry are on the verge of full swing currently with the imposition of section 144 there are barely any bookings being made for the future and the current ones all stand canceled in this scenario there is limited scope for quick revival\n",
      "its proud to see that this sector shows its maturity level in working together showing their true hospitality commitments in helping out our society where they can for example by making their venue available for hospital beds and hospital employees the situation we are in also brings new business models and opportunities in defining for instance new delivery concepts human capital sharing platforms initiatives in promoting the staycation or holiday concept and the use of the less productive time to work on activities that were normally pushed forward like asset counts security plans defining standard operating procedures social media plans etc\n",
      "this may seem obvious but its worth looking at this a bit closer the main reason there was such widespread panic was that the government announced its advice to avoid public meeting places like restaurants bars and pubs without simultaneously announcing a complete ban or a plan to support the businesses whose revenue streams theyd just denied many of these businesses operate on low margins and very fragile cash flow already so the prospect of survival for an indefinite period of time without income seemed very bleak indeed this has taken a mental toll on already stressed business owners and their worried staff\n",
      "the impact of the novel coronavirus on indias hospitality sector jobs is nothing short of severe while most economists expect things to rebound in the latter half of the year uncertainty still lurks a sheer job trauma is staring at the hospitality industry in the near future this is as the chances of losing a job are at high risk furthermore the entrylevel has postponed the hiring for the near future let us check here some of the facts concerning the drop in the various hotel occupancy sectors\n",
      "the hospitality industry can use this chasm to prepare for the upcoming demand by focusing on marketing and upgradation this stop gap plan is about maintaining a thread of communication using social media and advertisements with the consumers its also about strengthening the communication within the company making a budget and plan for reopening and utilizing this period to fix and upgrade whatever is possible another step is where all the action is required by the sector once the outbreak of the virus is contained and the world is set to travel again it is suggested that any plan of reopening must be done keeping longterm benefits and safety compliances in mind it is imperative that hospitality companies reach out to deferred and canceled bookings and give due attention to domestic travelers the hotels and airlines must slowly roll out their services rather than starting everything instantly and not get caught up in spendingthis way coronavirus effect on the hospitality\n",

      "the more you know about the past the better prepared you are for the future\n",
      "as we speak the world finds itself engulfed in one of its worst crises in recent times the global covid19 pandemic has caused neverseenbefore disruption in both public and economic life not only have factories shut down or supply chains abruptly stopped or millions of workers stranded but festivals suspended families separated across countries and publichealthcare systems put under tremendous stress such a scenario is a firsttime for many but the world has been through pandemics of a similar scale and nature before and after the due struggle emerged victoriously as the more experienced amongst us would remember the sars and mers outbreaks in the early 2000s presented a similar scenario although at a much lower rate of infection yet with higher rates of morbidity going back further in time the 1918 spanish flu brought a world just out of the first world war to a standstill considered to be the worst amongst modernera pandemics the influenza pandemic affected onethird of the worlds population and 50 million lives yet preventive measures such as socialdistancing quarantine massvaccinations public support and restraint have proved to be successful in all such situations even being effective in occasional plague outbreaks across the world we face a similar situation today  an extremely infectious virus which has already spread globally confined people to their homes and is causing tremendous economic loss every minute economic activity remains suspended affecting both the government and the industries alike \n",
      "can past similar incidents guide industries in such trying times can our governments take note of how publicpolicy measures adopted during the spanish flu sars and mers outbreak helped in eliminating such pandemics\n",
      "what can the government learn\n",
      "the panic due to the outbreak of covid19 and more importantly the lockdown measures to deal with it are quite similar to those during the 1918 influenza pandemic or as it is more commonly referred to as the spanish flu large cities around the world were put under strict lockdowns and businesses worldwide came to a grinding halt as large chunks of the population became bedridden\n",
      "the immediate consequences were the same as the ones observed in the past few weeks  rampant unemployment supply shortages and heavy reliance on social security systems causing a sudden strain on national economic resources\n",
      "impact  learnings\n",
      "effective and transparent communications are one of the most crucial and useful tools in disease control iran presents a great example of the damage that can be unleashed by a mediablackout secondly censorship might not be the best way to appease the masses during such times the longterm political impact of media censorship and manipulation of epidemicrelated facts in china is yet to be seen still the shortterm international unrest and dissent have only deteriorated international relations at the risk of quoting a cliché as well as the established streisand effect the truth always comes out no matter how many countries try to hide it\n",
      "the spanish flu spread was aggravated due to the failure of policymakers in adopting effective containment measures research shows that us cities which undertook measures to reduce contact amongst citizens in early1918 displayed significantly lower peak death rates compared to cities that failed to or were too late to adopt disease containment policies\n",
      "to quote the results from this 2007 study consistent with this hypothesis cities in which multiple interventions were implemented at an early phase of the epidemic had peak death rates 50 lower than those that did not and had lesssteep epidemic curves they also displayed lower cumulative mortality\n",
      "1 contrasting the death rates in philadelphia v st louis during the 1918 influenza outbreak\n",
      "as one might guess philadelphia was late to levy restrictions on gatherings parades and social distancing measures whereas st louis was not\n",
      "from the same study we see the definition of a popular phrase flattening the curve emerging  which is spreading out the rate of infection over time enabling health care systems to treat people in a staggered manner in line with available resources and to further corroborate this result the following graph from the same study shows the different trajectories followed by the disease in two cities of the us\n",
      "hence regardless of the multiple debunking claims of socialdistancing  lockdown as an effective preventive mechanism previous epidemics have taught us that they perform a marvelous job at flattening the curve\n",
      "social distancing  lockdown measures are effective only if sustained at least for a few months even after things start to improve\n",
      "markel 2007 shows the disastrous consequences that the early relaxation of bans on public gatherings in st louis had on death rates during the spanish flu the pullback of social distancing measures to pursue economic interests was premature and caused a sudden unprecedented surge in the number of deaths due to the flu\n",
      "2 deaths due to the spanish flu in st louis  a wider picture the black  grey lines show the duration for which socialdistancing measures were active\n",
      "another peak in death rates was observed only in cities that had relaxed distancing measures prematurely hence it is crucial to consider this past artifact when governments compare the inconveniences to the public  damage caused to the economy due to such measures with the benefits to the nation in terms of human life saved and then make the call as to when the restrictions must be eased\n",

      "these three trends are a valuable tool for both large scale players and regional retailers who now have the means to prioritize and predict consumerdemand and consequently alleviate a sudden strain on the product supply chain arising out of sudden  unexpected demands\n",
      "a peculiar outcome of such epidemics have been the somewhat permanent changes instilled in consumer buying trends across the inflicted regions across product categories  fresh staples see a sharp rise in their demand and product hygiene  safety standards are ranked higher up in the consumers priority list hence the advantage lies with producers who can quickly integrate changed consumerpreferences in their products showcase product reliability  quality and priced competitively given the prevalent context lastly previous pandemics have consolidated a longstanding theory which is true not just for the retail sector but for any consumercentric industry that there is  consumer loyalty is tried and tested during these times effective consumer relationship management crm can forge bonds that go a long way weathering through the thick and thin in such unprecedented times\n",

      "what did we fail to learn\n",
      "this global pandemic outbreak has made one thing painfully clear  there is a lack of global collaborative research on ways to combat the spread of such infectious diseases in the words of johan neyts professor of virology and president of the belgianbased international society for antiviral research isar health authorities failed to incorporate the learnings of the sars outbreak of the early 2000s partly because of the economic crisis of 2008 which squeezed funds from any potential research that could have been undertaken and partly because of the lack of seriousness in authorities in considering the efforts involved in dealing with the future expected breaks of coronavirus due to its seven different strains in existence \n",
      "the way forward\n",
      "all of these lessons come with a caveat  things change with time the modes of communication have changed both information  travel is much more accessible now we have fast planes  faster internet we have better healthcare capabilities and a much better if not perfect healthcare system in 1918 people didnt even know that a virus was causing the pandemic until much after its eradication today we already have extensive research going on for 70 different probable vaccines for the virus with a record setting pace in clinical trials and approvals\n",
      "we are much better equipped than what we were 100 years ago and at the same time somewhat underequipped to deal with it but these lessons from the various similar crises that humanity has faced and risen from act as a glimmer of hope in these dire times and if put to good use can aid in the fight against covid19 in the words of howard markel theres never been a better time in human history to have a pandemic than today with the exception of next week or a month later you want to kick that can down the road but its here today\n",

      "\n",
      "the current topic that is burning the world alive is the deadly coronavirus let us first understand what this coronavirus actually is according to the world health organization who the coronavirus disease which is called the covid19 is an infectious disease which is caused by the newly discovered coronavirus the covid19 virus is a virus that affects different people of the world in different ways the covid19 disease is a respiratory disease and most of the infected people will develop mild to moderate symptoms and recover without even requiring special treatment  the people who already have underlying medical conditions and those people who are over 60 years old have a higher risk of developing severe disease and death\n",
      "common symptoms include\n",
      "other symptoms include\n",
      "the people living in this world who have only mild symptoms of this deadly disease but are otherwise healthy should selfisolate and contact their medical provider or a covid19 information line for advice on testing and referral the people who have a fever cough or difficulty breathing should call their doctor and seek medical attention\n",
      "some key lessons from the deadly disease coronavirus in the last 3 months there has been a drastic change to human life all around the world the coronavirus outbreak happening in the world is no more just an epidemic but it is also considered as a global pandemic now the people everywhere in the world are being asked to stay home and stay away from other people so as to reduce the risk of infection\n",
      "the deadly disease coronavirus has brought with it a wave of negative outcomes terrible illness and death but at the same time it has also highlighted some important life lessons some of them are as follows\n",
      "1 you should be willing to trade some of your freedom for the greater good of the public there is no doubt for anyone that it has been difficult for everyone in the world to stay at home many people complaining about feeling bored and aimless some people may even have the feeling that it is a breach of their individual rights being made to stay home however when it comes to the greater good one should always be willing to sacrifice a little bit of that freedom a balance between individual rights and public safety is an everchanging thing trade a little bit of your freedom for the greater good of the public\n",
      "2 you should wash your hands whether theres a virus or not general hygiene is always important not just when there is a virus you should know the drill by now wet your hands lather them with soap scrub for 20 seconds rinse off dry with a clean towel washing hands on a regular basis are really the best way to keep safe because soap is a very effective way to kill viruses\n",
      "3 working from home should be an option for many in this time of the global outbreak of the coronavirus disease many people have learned that their jobs were possible to do from home most jobs have a certain amount of work that can be done remotely without the virus in place there should still be some system in place that will promote worklife balance\n",

      " it would also have to be seen how long this virus continues to affect india and going by the hygiene standard and herd mentality that we have the virus continues to affect us beyond 3 months and extends to 68 months quite obviously these packages would be grossly insufficient and more money will have to be pumped into the economy if the need arises currency notes will have to be printed and circulated and concerns about higher fiscal deficit should be simply pushed to the backseat the corporate sector and a section of largehearted people have also come forward at this time of distress to support the government initiatives in fighting this menace which should provide some financial comfort to the government\n",
      "the pandemic has appeared from nowhere as a potential death knell to the world economy which is already under stress and india is no exception there is no second opinion that this pandemic has hit the world very hard and would continue to do so in the foreseeable future whether india can emerge from the medical pandemic as well as the economic pandemic relatively unscathed remains to be seen we will have to take care of our lives as well as the livelihoods of our citizens as indians we hope we shall overcome  together we can do this and we will\n",

      "in todays day and age of hyperconnectivity celebrities  dubbed by fraser and brown 2002 as people who are famous for being famous and may or may not always serve others sacrificially  live in glass houses that are open to the prying eyes of the public notification bars are ever abuzz with news about when these celebrities wake up what they wear to the gym what they eat and where they go on their vacations in the idealized and idolized eyes with which society views celebrities this unceasing visibility gives them an allpervasive influence the dominance of celebrities in swaying opinions of their acolyte is wellestablished  from advertisements in the print and pixel mediums brand endorsements and integrations the evidence of exploiting celebrity influence is vast however today more than ever before this influence is creeping away from the world of consumerism and into governance policy and politics with an increasing number of public figures overtly taking strong and stronger political stances making moves charged with a political motive and eventually entering the sphere of legislature and bureaucracy the scope of having a public influence has come to mean much more than it used to thereby begging the question  how wellplaced are personage in the world of politics should celebrities be allowed to join politics\n",

      "although the phenomenon of the seeping of public influence into public policy has stretched through much of the 20th century choi and berger 2001 suggest that the celebritypolitics connect continues to strengthen much more than it did a few decades ago as we trudge further into the century of the myriad causalities that underlie this circumstance the global internet where fame isnt restricted to the confines of tangible achievement has been theorized to be a significant driver in her 2009 book hyde labels this spectacle as a mission creep where the enterprise of celebrities is expanding beyond its primary goals\n",
      "a prodigious public following seems to be the parallel between the worlds of politics and personage which paves the path for celebrities to cross over to politics celebrities seem to be able to transition into politics with a certain grace having already learned to live in the publics eye and established themselves allowing the carryover of their alreadyknown traits as celebrities into their role as policymakers the visibility that autochthonous politicians work years to nurture celebrities already have as they descend into the political sphere in one of the bestknown instances of a celebrity transitioning into politics ronald reagan walked away from hollywood and into the white house carrying with him his trademark charismatic onscreen personality that spilled over into his politics initially serving as the governor of california for 15 years in the late 1960s reagan served two terms at the oval office the voters knew who ronald was  those who closely followed the trends of the red and blue  but also those who did not giving reagan the edge that propelled him towards success on the other side of the globe india saw much the same trend as an onscreen persona aiding the creation of an offscreen political career ramanand sagars television series ramayan based on the hindu mythological epic was revolutionary in the pious indian society of the 1980s when television shows were still novel it has been recounted on many an occasion that audiences would often offer their prayers to the television screen every time arun govil who portrayed the deity ram made an appearance on screen having garnered a devout dutiful fan following govil and his other coactors from the show turned to the world of politics where their godly association in the publics eyes helped them make a mark even the philippines has shown ample evidence of celebrities time and again swooping in to claim political victory with their stardom and popularity that their opponents lack\n",
      "very often the sentiment of antiincumbency seems to be the golden ticket that lets celebrity politicians snatch political power from consummate politicians indeed various political theorists suggest that antiincumbency happens to be amongst the more effective strategies to secure vote banks until 31st december 2018 ukrainian actor screenwriter and director volodymyr zelensky only played the lead in a sitcom that tells the story of a schoolteacher who accidentally becomes the president it was that winter that zelensky claimed that he was contesting the presidential elections to change the mood and timbre of the political establishment and to bring professional decent people to power zelensky took the premise of his wildly popular show from the reel to the real as he crushed rival a seasoned politician and incumbent poroshenko in a landslide victory has zelensky proved a better representative of his people than his predecessor time is yet to deliver its verdict but the gushes that he invoked in the people of ukraine and his plea to oust the ruling class played their role in assuring zelensky 73 of the plebiscite in the early 2010s in india similar antiincumbent sentimentalities were played into by the many celebrities including musician vishal dadlani hockey legend dhanraj pillay singer jaspinder narula and others  all of whom joined hands with arvind kejriwals  aam aadmi movement that aimed to rid the existing political system of its ills\n",
      "and so innumerable celebrities across countries and cultures claim the throne in fact a wikipedia page that maintains an inventory of actorpolitician spanning the atlas claims that it may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness  depicting the sheer number of celebrities who reroute to politics this begets questioning the congruence of the world of personage and that of politics \n",
      "in a research article published in 1995 meyer and gamson articulated the possibility of celebrities choosing to politically address only broadly acceptable social causes because they understand their power rests with staying popular thereby failing to make any appreciable difference this seems to ring true with some celebrity politicians in india especially ones who are nominated to the upper house of the parliament but fail abysmally to leave a mark one of many such representatives is gautam gambhir a cricketerturnedpolitician who has mostly been shunned for his abject performance in the parliament hema malini another popular actress who turned to politics came under heavy criticism when her claim to be a protector of womens rights wasnt backed by an effort to fulfill her promises owing to such instances research findings such as those by nisbett and dewalt 2016 find that the public often questions the intentions of the celebrities who venture into politics it may also seem that in entering politics and failing to deliver celebrity politicians often deprive grassroot political workers of the chance to enter the mainstream of politics\n",
      "however there is ample evidence from around the globe that goes to prove that celebrities can in fact make their mark in the world of governance independent of their primary identities take the south indian state of tamil nadu for instance where the political ethos has been consistently overshadowed by celebrities from the world of showbiz for at least the last 40 years as per data from the ministry of statistics  programme implementation tamil nadu is amongst the topperforming states in the country having the secondhighest gdp most celebrities in tamil nadu who approached politics have exhibited extraordinary political will and caliber the late actorpolitician j jayalalithaa or amma ran successful terms as chief minister and is still considered a mother figure by hordes of her followers another stalwart in the landscape of tamil nadu dr mg ramachandran continues to be celebrated as one of the most influential chief ministers and is lauded for his largescale reforms in being the forerunner of some of the changes that propelled the state towards progress including easing caste tensions and other communal violence mgr as he is better known is remembered as much for his governance as he is for his innings on screen\n",
      "more often than not celebrity engagement in politics has been used to woo voters from the younger strata of the population empirical studies such as the one by austin vord pinkleton and epstein 2008 have conclusively shown to enhance political engagement by younger voters  along similar lines jackson 2008 found that young people are more likely to agree with political positions that are endorsed by politicians in fact many modern political theorists are of the belief that the involvement of celebrities in politics allows for otherwise uninvolved or apathetic veins of the demographic to be active participants in democracy hillary clinton aimed to do just that when she got the billboardtopping artists beyonce and jayz to take centerstage at her rally in cleveland in the weeks leading up to the 2016 us presidential elections  in fact as multiple sources suggest this rally did see a surge in millennial supporters in such a case it might be in the benefit of the community to have more celebrities endorse and engage in politics in order to nurture a more vibrant and engaged youth   \n",
      "from our vantage point today the relationship between personage and politics seems to be a central fixture in society and is here to stay what remains to be done however is to ensure the symbiotic course of this relationship  to scrutinize and critique the celebrities who knock the doors of politics and to secure their promises of beneficence and nonmaleficence to the public that it seeks to serve yet it may seem that these are benchmarks that need to be met by any and all servants of the people  celebrity or not but in the world that we live in this is certainly not the case politicians  celebrity or not largely happen upon the sphere of governance without a lot of experience backing them and learn to navigate the maze of politics on the job ultimately like all things in democracy the government is of the people and its representatives are of them and for them the eventual endorsement of its leaders  celebrity or not  can come not from databased analyses and elaborate critique but from the people should celebrities be allowed to enter politics the question remains unanswered or rather is answered by the democratic exercise itself  with the beeps of electronic ballots election after election when the people  the real influencers choose\n",

      "\n",
      "frankly no the state of the public healthcare system still vast is very fragmented and cannot scale up rapidly enough to face the challenge of a pandemic such as covid19 the origin of public healthcare lies in the british colonial period where such facilities were provided only to british officers and their families stationed in india from the 1960s onwards the independent government of india stressed more upon healthcare and it led to the creation of the modern public healthcare system in india the healthcare system is organized into primary secondary and tertiary levels at the primary level are sub centres and primary health centres phcs at the secondary level there are community health centres chcs and smaller subdistrict hospitals finally the top level of public care provided by the government is the tertiary level which consists of medical colleges and districtgeneral hospitals the number of phcs chcs sub centres and district hospitals has increased in the past six years although not all of them are up to the standards set by indian public health standards but there are still critical challenges to the existing system\n",
      "one of the major areas is the lack of awareness of diseases especially communicable diseases among the general population of india this challenge becomes more complicated at the lower strata of society especially poor households migrant laborers and homeless people who do not have the proper channels of communication available to get the necessary information from the health experts add low educational status poor functional literacy low accent on education within the healthcare system and low priority for health in the population among others and you see the magnitude of the problem according to a recent study initiated by the faculty and students of iithyderabad and iitbombay in tier1 cities it was found that about 12 percent of the respondents switched from public to private mode during the third week of covid19 this modal shift was about 9 percent in tier2 cities and about 7 percent in tier3 cities moreover nearly 48 percent of people said that they did not travel to work during the third week of march whereas 28 percent had the same frequency of travel to work when inquired about the cancellation of trips between the cities using major modes of transportation around 18 percent said they cancelled their flights whereas 20 per cent of respondents cancelled their train journeys this indicates that awareness about covid19 is higher in tier1 cities in comparison with tier2 and tier3 cities but national level state level and doortodoor campaigns along with targeted media campaigns may enable the knowledge of the pandemic to spread fast among the local populace\n",
      "the second challenge is access to public healthcare in india access to healthcare is defined by the oxford dictionary as the right or opportunity to use or benefit from healthcare physical reach is one of the basic determinants of access defined as  the ability to enter a healthcare facility within 5 km from the place of residence or work using this definition a study in india in 2012 found that in rural areas only 37 of people were able to access ip facilities within a 5 km distance and 68 were able to access outpatient facilities furthermore it was postulated that in general the more rustic rural ones existence  the further one lives from towns  the greater are the odds of disease malnourishment weakness and premature death\n",
      "the third is the planning portion related to the preparedness of the pandemic planning for a pandemic such as covid19 has never been done extensively in india as we had no recent history of such a communicable disease which spreads rapidly in crowded locations which about a quarter of the population live in the recent national lockdown called led to an increase in police violence who have not been sensitized how to deal in such a crisis and the humanitarian crisis facing migrant laborers an important part of the indian economy who have lost their jobs and facing a lack of public transport have to force to walk thousands of miles to reach their native villages the ongoing slump in the economy has been further exacerbated by the pandemic and the resultant lockdown and there have been growing complaints by healthcare professionals who are fighting in the front of this pandemic of lack of protective personal equipments ppes to protect themselves and their patients from covid19 the lockdown has hit hiv and chronic patients hard who need constant medication to maintain their fragile condition elderly people who are often alone and have medical conditions have been left without essential support ironically these are the same group of people who are at an immediate threat from covid19\n",
      "i am optimistically hoping based on the ingenious and creativity of our citizens that we tide over these tough times and fundamental changes to our healthcare system are made with this sober learning experience to prevent a repeat of what is happening today\n",

      "every prophet of doom unless he also happens to be a psychopath hopes that his predictions will not be borne out this is also true for the epidemiologists and virologists who have been warning the world since january that the novel sarscov2 virus poses a severe threat to public health around the world the name coronavirus itself is vicious enough to terrify those who otherwise are fearless in the face of any ball game tracing back the origins of the now pandemic we find that the coronavirus emerged in wuhan a city of 11 million people in chinas hubei province in late 2019 cases of the disease grew by several thousand per day in china in late january and early february the peak of the epidemic there the number of infections appearing each day has since plummeted in china making the outbreak a global pandemic that has engulfed over 214 countries around the globe\n",
      "besides being a health crisis the virus has already brought a major downfall in the world economy with the imf estimating the coronavirusinduced global downturn to be way worse than financial crisis as the coronavirus spreads across the globe it appears to be setting off a devastating feedback loop with another of the gravest forces of our time economic inequality research suggests that those in lower economic strata are likelier to catch the disease owing to their inability to meet the rising drug prices according to the international labour organizationilo covid19 will have farreaching impacts on labor market outcomes beyond the urgent concerns about the health of workers and their families the virus and the subsequent economic shocks will impact the world of work across three key dimensions\n",
      "initial ilo estimates point to a significant rise in unemployment and underemployment in the wake of the virus based on different scenarios for the impact of covid19 on global gdp growth preliminary ilo estimates indicate a rise in global unemployment of between 53 million low scenario and 247 million high scenario from a base level of 188 million in 2019 the mid scenario suggests an increase of 13 million 74 million in highincome countries though these estimates remain highly uncertain all figures indicate a substantial rise in global unemployment for comparison the global financial crisis of 20089 increased unemployment by 22 million while selfemployment does not typically react to economic downturns it acts as a default option for survival or maintaining income  often in the informal economy for this reason informal employment tends to increase during crises however the current limitations on the movement of people and goods may restrict this type of coping mechanism\n",
      "labour supply is declining because of quarantine measures and a fall in economic activity at this point a preliminary estimate suggests that infected workers have already lost nearly 30000 work months with the consequent loss of income for unprotected workers employment impacts imply large income losses for workers overall losses in labour income are expected in the range of between 860 and 3440 billion usd the loss of labour income will translate into lower consumption of goods and services which is detrimental to the continuity of businesses and ensuring that economies are resilient working poverty is also likely to increase significantly the strain on incomes resulting from the decline in economic activity will devastate workers close to or below the poverty line the growth impacts of the virus used for the unemployment estimates above suggest an additional 88 million people in working poverty around the world than originally estimated ie an overall decline of 52 million working poor in 2020 compared to a decline of 14 million estimated precovid19 under the mid and high scenarios there will be between 201 million and 350 million more people in working poverty than before the precovid19 estimate for 2020\n",
      "who are particularly vulnerableepidemics and economic crises can have a disproportionate impact on certain segments of the population which can trigger worsening inequality based on past experience and current information on the covid19 pandemic and insights from previous crises a number of groups can be identified\n",
      "the extent and severity to which the coronavirus pandemic will impact the fight to end extreme poverty is still unknown but it is expected that the crisis will devastate the worlds most vulnerable people including the world of work the virus is already disproportionately impacting the poor in wealthy countries where the most known cases are concentrated experts are urging the world to prepare to lend extra support to lowincome countries to address the pandemic covid19 cases are more likely to go undetected or to be underdetected in developing countries that have fewer resources available to tackle a pandemic countries with large poor populations including brazil india indonesia nigeria and pakistan have confirmed few cases but have been slow to respond to the threat according to npr preventative care and health education are less accessible to lowincome people who are more likely to have preexisting conditions catch covid19 and die from it people living in poverty are also more likely to hold insecure jobs and cannot afford to stay home sick from work\n",
      "in times of crisis international labour standards provide a strong foundation for key policy responses that focus on the crucial role of decent work in achieving a sustained and equitable recovery to mitigate the impacts of covid19 on the world of work these standards adopted by representatives of governments workers and employers organizations provide a humancentered approach to growth and development including by triggering policy levers that both stimulate demand and protect workers and enterprises\n",
      "policy responses should focus on two immediate goals health protection measures and economic support on both the demand and supplyside of the associated cause\n",
      "in such challenging times many countries have come forward to protect their workers in the workplace with decisive measures to combat the spread of the disease while ameliorating its pernicious effect on the economy and labor market across the three policy pillars protecting workers in the workplace stimulating the economy and labor demand and supporting employment and income some of the policies include working arrangements including telework occupational safety and health osh advice expanded access to paid sick leave prevention of discrimination and exclusion while these measures will no doubt help to contain the pandemic to respond to the emergency needs it has generated and to pave the way to a gradual recovery it is clear that more needs to be done past crises and the experiences of countries which have reacted too late in the context of the current covid19 crisis show that preparedness and early action is critical\n",
      "the coronavirus pandemic is a test its a test of medical capacity and political will its a test of endurance and forbearance for believers a test of religious faith its a test too of a different kind of faith in the strength of the ideas humans choose to help them form moral judgments and guide personal and social behavior the epidemic forces everyone to confront deep questions of human existence questions so profound that they have previously been answered in many different ways by the greatest philosophers its a test of where all humans stand what is right and what is wrong what can individuals expect from society and what can society expect of them should others make sacrifices for me and vice versa is it just to set economic limits to fighting a deadly disease how long will we stay that way and as the epidemic grows worse and brings the disease within fewer degrees of separation for everyone we may well find that the notion of loving thy neighbor as thyself becomes far more potentat last i would like to conclude by saying that covid19 is something we all face as a community and thus something that we have to solve as a community not with weapons but with goodwill and common efforts\n",

      "from alibaba to ping an and google to ford companies around the globe are telling staff to figure from directly from home in a bid to stem the spread of covid19 such remote functioning at scale is unprecedented and can leave a longlasting impression on the way people live and work for several years to return china which felt the primary impact of the pandemic was an early mover during this space as home to a number of the worlds largest firms it offers lessons for people who are just commencing to embrace the shift working from home skyrocketed in china within the wake of the covid19 crisis as companies told their employees to remain home around 200 million people were working remotely by the tip of the chinese new year holiday while this arrangement has some benefits like avoiding long commutes many employees and firms found it challenging one employee at a web company quipped his workday changed from 996 to 007 meaning from nine to nine 6 days every week to all or any the time on the private front employees found it difficult to manage kids homeschooling via video conference while coordinating with remote colleagues at an organization level many felt that productivity rapidly tailed off if not managed properly if done right remote working can boost productivity and morale done badly it can breed inefficiency damage work relationships and demotivate employees these kind of things are happening due to the impacts of covid19 on the world of work\n",
      "teams or whole business units working remotely can quickly end in confusion and a scarcity of clarity being isolated ends up in uncertainty about who to speak to on specific issues and the way and when to approach them resulting in holdups and delays thats why establishing a structure and architecture for deciding and effective communication is vital here smaller crossfunctional teams are helpful each with a transparent mission and reporting line where directions and tasks are easy to implement this also simplifies onboarding new hires who can integrate faster in a very tightknit group at a time when the broad sweep of the organization isnt visible or easy to feel with fewer in each team theres longer to urge to understand one another and build the trust that will grow more organically within the office at ping an insurance workers are typically grouped in project teams of at most 30 members while larger business units are divided to assist them to stay agile strong companywide foundations underpin this like having a typical purpose and unified goals providing clarity on what decisions to escalate and which of them is tackled at the team level helps drive progress to mitigate the consequences of closed retail stores one leading fashion company founded a technique room and redeployed staff into four crossfunctional squads to support its frontline it designed standard ways for live broadcasting and established internal best practices to encourage frontline staff to use new retail tools to drive sales remotely\n",
      " the lesson putting in small crossfunctional teams with clear objectives and a typical purpose keeps everyone on the identical strategic course\n",
      "managing people is one of the foremost difficult elements of remote working not least because everyone will respond differently to the cultural shift and challenges of the homeworking environment leaders have to energize the entire company by setting a transparent direction and communicating it effectively offering a powerful vision and a sensible outlook can have a strong effect on motivation across the organization its essential to foster an outcomedriven culture that empowers and holds teams answerable for getting things done while encouraging open honest and productive communication empowering your team in this way pays dividendswesure a part of leading internet company tencent assembled a covid19 response team5 at the beginning of the year to supply amount freed from charge to frontline medical workers\n",
      "alan lau ceo of wesure credited his team saying that they had worked nonstop many from remote locations while inactive during the chinese new year break demonstrating how responsive they were to the vision\n",
      "for managers the challenge is to guide inspire and direct their team in their daily course of labor while being physically remote upping the amount of interaction can even work well here one chief information officer responding to a mckinsey survey said hes texting the whole company with regular updates because its a more human way of communicating than via the official corporate channels when working within distributed teams ecommerce giant alibaba increases the frequency of its onetoone communications with employees to a weekly basis and in some teams members submit a weekly report for his or her colleagues complete with plans for the week ahead alibabas productivity app dingtalk ding ding has features inbuilt to facilitate this by allowing managers to send voicetotext messages to their teams and to test in on progress\n",
      "the lesson determining how you communicate is simply as important as whats being said and it has to be done confidently consistently and reliably\n",
      "as companies transition to the new normal its important to acknowledge that some employees are also facing other pressures reception including caring for his or her children when schools are shut resulting in feelings of isolation and insecurity business leaders must respect and address these additional needs empathy may be a crucial tool here offering how to attach promote inclusiveness and make a way of community in a very barren of physical interaction increasing social interactions within the team particularly through oneonone catchup guards against feelings of isolation and demoralization and creates space for people to talk up and share their thoughts by creating a way of psychological safety for his or her colleagues being inclusive in deciding and offering perspective in challenging moments managers can stay closer to whats occurring surface issues and help their teams solve problems effectively a similar approach is very important when coping with customers and clients providing valuable stability and enabling them to navigate unknown waters confidently as an example one global bank asked their relationship managers to attach with smallbusiness customers via wechat and video calls to know their situation and help them weather the crisis to try and do so effectively at scale the managers are supported through dedicated product programs online articles scripts for communicating with clients and internal training inclusion is that the ultimate show of empathy creating outlets for sharing best practices success stories challenges and watercooler chat are significant to making a persons connection giving employees space to pursue personal or social endeavors providing a transparent span of control and assigning meaningful tasks also can spur motivation \n",
      "the lesson connecting on a private level and instilling empathy within the culture is doubly important when working remotely\n",
      "moving to remote working risks disrupting the officebased flows and rhythms and it will be easy to hit the incorrect note or miss important virtual meetings thanks to packed schedules spend time along with your team addressing the nuts and bolts of how youll work together cover the daily rhythm individual constraints and specific norms youll decide to and anticipate what might get it wrong and the way youll mitigate it how companies plan and review their workflows has to change to reflect this the challenges of the new working pattern and of not being in one room together will be overcome by creating a digitally facilitated cadence of meetings\n",
      "one leading insurance firm adopted agile practices across its teams with a daily and weekly ritual of checkins sprint planning and review sessions as alibaba embraced remote working it also made sure its meetings were more tightly run one person is assigned to trace time and manage the outcomes team members can rate a meetings usefulness by employing a fivestar system that gives immediate feedback and positive ways forward to address the challenge of launching a digital business with an oversized remote team one company created a replacement workflow for product requirements that clearly outlined the use of digital tools roles and responsibilities as requirements moved from ideation to validation to delivery stages reiteration of decisionmaking structures like this isnt always necessary when people can communicate directly but their absence will be keenly felt when remote working kicks in \n",
      "the lesson establishing robust working norms workflows and features of authority is critical but only too easy to stint on\n",
      "the final lesson being able to recognize what isnt working and changing it fast\n",
      "these are the impacts of covid19 on the world of work leadership teams that continuously learn actively identify best practices and rapidly founded mechanisms to share ideas across the organization tend to be most successful within the future rd teams at one leading hightech manufacturer created a productivity target for remote work by estimating their productivity hebdomadally relative to onsite work and identifying levers to enhance it within four weeks they had progressed from 50 percent to 88 percent of their baseline as chinas workforce begins to return to offices these lessons from a number of its leading companies help as an example of howwith the correct structure culture processes and technologyworking remotely can boost productivity and morale employees who spend less time traveling or commuting and have a much better worklife balance are likely to be happier more motivated and prepared to mobilize in extreme situations embracing remote working allows companies to define a brand new normal that drives productivity and employee satisfaction into the longer term alibaba launched taobao by now the worlds biggest ecommerce website while the staff was working remotely on quarantine during the 2003 sars outbreak for tripcom an overseas working experiment in 20147 established the foundations for nice customer service and versatile working culture hence bringing together all the weather can enable a brand new way of working that may make your company suited the futurewhatever which will hold these are policies that will mitigate the impacts of covid19 on the world of work\n",

      "now coming to the opportunities that big data provides they are not just limited to healthcare big data analysis is now a disruptive technology which has intervened into numerous fields and proved its worth healthcare is no exception big data has the potential to change the entire dynamics of the healthcare industry and improve the quality of life of people healthcare industry is a very large and complicated system it involves a lot of risks and always demands better care however when a large number of patients seek emergency care the complications as well as the cost rise exponentially in india many times we even lack sufficient infrastructure to support the patients there is a deficit of beds as well as doctors to provide treatment to the patients for instance when epidemics break out and lives are lost at a very alarming rate we can easily gauge our helplessness however the scenario is certainly improving now with the advent of digitization into the healthcare system healthcare providers or practitioners are now having access to a huge amount of patient health data this healthcare big data can be processed and analyzed to identify patient patterns more quickly and effectively the information obtained can be extremely useful to figure out chronic health issues and provide preventive treatment plans well beforehand so as to curb that disease or disorder from occurring this method is also known as predictive analysis and it is one of the most crucial benefits of big data in healthcare this technology can help the healthcare industry in more ways than we can infer healthcare organizations that have implemented predictive analysis have witnessed a reduction in er visits by providing support and care to patients and decreasing emergency situations\n",
      "apart from reduced er visits and timely treatment there are many other benefits of big data and predictive analysis patients with highrisk lifethreatening issues can be provided with more customized treatment facilities due to lack of data there exists a lack of proper planning in hospitals under or overbooking of staff lack of medical equipment medicines and other facilities are a result of inefficient budgeting and illmanagement of finances using predictive analysis these problems can be solved which will lead to reduced costs and efficient management of finances better staff allocation and admission rate prediction shall facilitate improvement in daily operations of healthcare organizations by using big data the effect of recency bias could be reduced as well when we give more importance to recent events and tend to ignore the effect of the older ones it may lead to incorrect decisions this is known as recency bias big data also helps in preventing fraudulent activities which in turn prevents losses of insurance companies \n",
      "while all of this is changing the healthcare industry for the better it is not that easy to reap the benefits of big data there are a whole lot of challenges and vulnerabilities attached to its implementation one of the biggest challenges is security healthcare big data contains the personal information and health history of patients acts of hacking cyber theft and phishing pose a serious threat to these databases such data could be stolen and sold for huge sums of money protection of the patients privacy hence is a serious challenge to big data implementation also the data would contain external data apart from medical information the organization therefore has to take care of privacy legal compliances and government policies privacy and security of patients have to be given utmost importance and no breach of any kind can be permitted\n",
      "the next challenge is data classification and modeling the size of the data is massive and it is less structured and heterogeneous classifying such massive data to identify relevant information is a big challenge modeling of such unstructured data is equally difficult \n",
      "storage and retrieval is another major challenge huge cloud servers with sufficient space are required to store such voluminous data also the speed should be high so that uploading of data can be done hasslefree the way storage is a challenge retrieval also is a matter of concern integrating the data and getting all relevant systems to link each other is a tough job \n",
      "the next challenge is a major one in my opinion finding the right\n",
      "talent who own the expertise to implement this modern technology is an arduous\n",
      "task shortage of required talent is a crisis in the market today even after\n",
      "hiring the right talent it is a challenge to retain them scarce resources like\n",
